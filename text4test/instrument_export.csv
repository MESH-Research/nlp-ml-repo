"Navigational Theodolite","<p>This is a large theodolite inside a wooden box that is painted khaki green. The box is simply made, with a hinged door on one side that can be held shut with two latches. On top of the box there is a metal handle. The box's corners are reinforced by metal covers. Inside the box, fixed inside the door in a leather pocket with an open bottom, there is a conical plumb bob with a string attached to the top. This is wrapped in brown paper. In another leather pocket on one side of the interior of the box there is a small screwdriver with a wooden handle. </p>
<p>The theodolite stands on a rectangular metal base, supported from a stand in the centre. In one corner of the base, there is a cylindrical piece with a slanted top; inside this, there is a brown circular section. In another corner, there is a wooden cylinder containing three small lightbulbs, two small rods tools stored vertically, and an additional tool that can be accessed by unscrewing the lid of a cylindrical case. The tool is fixed into this lid and has a delicate broad base. </p>
<p>The base of the instrument is circular and made of brass. This supports an adjustable stand with four screw posts supporting the larger circular disk that supports the instruments other components. The disk and components are painted black with a textured surface. The disk base has two roughly triangular supports standing on either side of it, which supports a telescope tube between them on a broad rod, enabling it to be tilted in one dimension. A spoked wheel with a scale around the rim, graduated in degrees, permits the angle of the tilt to be measured. The telescope objective end is covered with a round cover. </p>
<p>At the intersection of the telescope and the support rod, there is a box shape. This connects, through the centre of the spoked wheel to an eyepiece tube with a lens and rubber eyecup at the end. Emerging from the side of this tube there is a second smaller lens. There is a brass knob on the other side of the main tube. A wire runs from the end of the tube around the instrument to a battery case consisting of a pair of vertical cylinders on the other side of the instrument. Beneath the eyepiece tube, there is knob with a central indicator. This has ""INCREASE VOLUME"" and a directional arrow printed on it. </p>
<p>There are various other knobs, screw and adjustents on the instrument, allowing it to be finely adjusted. In the centre of the disk stand there are a pair of bubble levels set at right angles to one another.</p>

"Otis King’s Calculator ‘L’ model","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Otis King’s patent calculator is a cylindrical pocket slide rule with helical scales from the 1920s. The calculator can be used for multiplication, division, proportion and percentages. This ‘L’ model also has a linearly divided scale section on the top providing logarithms and allows you to work out powers and roots. The scale on this calculator is equivalent to a 66-inch slide rule calculator and thus the compact size of the Otis King’s calculator makes it more convenient to use.</p>

"Telescope Tripod","<p>This is a wooden telescope tripod. It has four wooden legs which consist of two wooden rods with a wooden piece sliding between them. This can be slid out and fixed in place via a screw knob on a metal bracket at the base of the legs in order to extend the length of the legs. Each leg ends in a metal section that is roughly rectangular and then narrows to a point. Each one of these has a triangular bracket on the external side.</p>
<p>Each leg is attached at the top to a triangular metal section, painted black, and hinged. This allows the legs to be widened or narrowed to stand the tripod up. When the legs are closed, there are two leather belts that can be belted around the three legs of the tripod to keep them together. A leather carrying handle is affixed to both these belts.</p>
<p>Emerging from the top of the metal triangular section that holds the legs together there is a metal support tube. This rotates and can be fixed in place by means of a black metal screw. Affixed to the top of the tube there is a metal loop. This is split and has a screw across the gap that allows it to be loosened and tightened around a cylindrical object, such as a telescope. The angle of this loop can be adjusted.</p>

The clock served as a functional house clock until the 1950's, during Dr. C.A Chant's tenure as Director.","Good: The overall condition of the clock's case is very good. The clock's varnish shows natural lightening from age, and exposure to light. The original varnish would have been much darker to suit the choice of walnut wood. The wood of the clock does not have any odor or water-damage, it is dry and shows no signs of warping. The clock head is in overall good condition. The left oval ornament on the face carving is loose, and can be rotated. There is moderate wear, where the varnish has been removed, along the ridge of right-side molding on door. The varnish is worn in three locations on the left upper and lower molding ridges.

The interior of the case is in poor condition. Several key components of the clock are missing, including the pendulum and some mechanical elements. The string has been cut and is dangling beneath the mechanism box. The natural fibre of the string is fraying in places. There appears to be some water damage inside the case.

Other components:
2014.ast.32.2 (Keys): The keys are oxidized over their surfaces, although less so on their ends. The paperclip that links them is also oxidized.
2014.ast.32.3-4 (weights): The clock weights are stored separately from the clock. Both have spots of corrosion around their bodies and around the base. One (2014.ast.32.3) is badly dented on one side of its base.
2014.ast.32.5-6 (pulleys): The two wooden pulleys are worn and dirty, but in good condition. The metal sections are oxidized and dulled, but not corroded.
2014.ast.32.7 (rod): This component has a brass section, which has small spots of corrosion on its surface, and a narrower iron section; this is badly rusted along its length.

"Constant Deviation Wavelength Spectroscope","<p>This is a spectroscope coated in a mottled grey-green paint with the collimator and eyepiece set at right angles to one another. The spectroscope sits on a metal base consisting of one foot affixed to an arched section into which a roughly rectangular rail could be inserted; no rail is present. There are two round holes in the top of this. One pillar supports the instrument.</p>
<p>The spectroscope has a metal body and consists of two tubes at right angles to one another, joining at a box. This box can be lifted off to reveal a four-sided prism sitting on a platform. The prism is fixed in place by a bracket and a screw. The platform is connected via an arm to a mechanism that emerges from the box. A metal rotating drum cut with a spiral indentation around its length which is labelled with decimal numbers from 0.9 to 0.39, can be turned to press against this arm and slightly adjust the platform on which the prism sits. A small metal strip engraved with an arrow and attached to a needle underneath runs in the drum as an indicator.</p>
<p>The eyepiece tube emerges from the prism casing with an arched section sitting on a support arm with an adjustment knob underneath. On top of this, there is a round opening covered in a window, behind which is visible part of a scale with a red indicator line on the window glass. This arched section ends in a short section of tubing with a screw tightener on the top. Into this is inserted a plastic tube with a metal end with the eyepiece lens at the other end. The other tube, the collimator tube, also emerges from the prism casing as an arched section sitting on top of a support arm; this converts directly into a tube. Underneath the arched section, there is an adjustment knob. At the end of this, there is a disk-shaped black section with a hole in the end. Just inside of this there are two metal plates next to one another creating a narrow slit. Supported over the slit with a series of narrow metal rods there is a small right-angled prism. Just above the slit opening, there is a small knurled knob, and just below it a round opening with numbers visible inside. Sitting vertically on the top of the disk there is knob with a knurled end and a scale around the rim, and next to this a small adjustment arm.</p>

<p>Below this there is a row of round red plugs and round black plugs. Between these two, there is the word ""OUT"". To the right of each pair of plugs, there is a silver bolt adjuster with a screw top with ""OFFSET"" written next to it. Stored pointing down into the Styrofoam is a small yellow-ended screwdriver that would fit the screw end of the bolts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>715.3 Recorder: On the right side of the case is a grey galvanometer/ recorder which appears to be designed to stand up as it has four rubber feet at the base. However, the case is lying down on its back. On what is now the upward-facing wall of the case is a narrow rectangular orange plastic window opening. The plastic window is labelled 1 through 12 on a scale. Below this, there is a piece of paper taped to the window with a similar scale labelled ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 11, 10, 9 TM"". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The panel containing the window can be lifted by depressing a metal pin. Underneath the panel, a series of gold resistors are supported between upright pins on a yellow board. Between them, there is a line of fourteen upright narrow cylinders with silver screw-ends, each marked with handwriting that labels or dates (?) them. Above that, there is a row of square adjuster heads, each corresponding to a label: T1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, T2. Mounted vertically next to the cylinders is a panel with shiny glass edges. Below that, a series of rollers that are intended to draw through probably electrically/heat sensitive paper tape. Again, where lines would be drawn, the roller is labelled 1-12. Also under this lid is a tiny square-headed screwdriver attached to the apparatus by a small chain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the left edge of this grey case there are four dials in a recessed space labelled top to bottom ""L. INT"", ""RUN TIME"", ""SPEED"" and ""CHECK"". Beneath them, in another recessed space there is another dial labeled ""DRIVE"", a small yellow blob labelled ""POWER LIGHT"" and a red-tipped toggle switch labelled ""ON"" and ""OFF"".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the top of the grey case, the black wire from the control panel is connected. On the other side of the top of the grey case, a pair of wires in black and red are connected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>715.4 Power Inverter: This pair of wires is connected to a panel on the right-hand side, a roughly square small metal grey box sitting just above the control panel. There is a second pair of red and black wires with silver metal connectors coming out of this panel that are not connected to anything. A third wire connected wire is the grey wire connected to the top right of the control panel. Also on this box there is a silver toggle switch labelled ""MASTERPWR"" and ""ON"" and ""OFF"".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stored in a specially-sized hole in the styrofoam above the control panel, there is a small cylindrical fuse. There are also some additional short unconnected wires stored in the case.</p>

Behind it, there are a series of thin, semi-circular metal fins that are held in place by three long screws, two parallel, one below, which connect to the facade and to a smaller piece of black plastic behind them. In between the two screws in parallel is a thick, cylindrical metal bar, which is connected to the dial and can be freely rotated by turning the dial. Affixed to this screw is another row of thin, semi-circular metal fins. These fit between the other fins, and rotating the dial adjusts the degree to which these two sets of fins overlap with each other.</p>

"Glass Apparatus","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Large glass instrument which is approximately eighty centimeters tall. The instrument is made of two glass spheres connected by glass cylinders to make one piece. The top of the piece is broken off, but based on photographs of the instrument before it was broken, it would have had the mouth of the instrument and tapered into a first cylinder which would have had two large tubes extending from either side. Tissue paper has been stuffed inside the broken part of the structure in order to provide support and prevent further damage. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top cylinder would have been soldered onto the second unbroken cylinder, from which two additional glass tubes extend. Each of the tubes is widest at the base where it connects to the cylinder and taper towards the end. Straight and even glass tubes are also present inside each extension. Visible from the outside is an additional glass piece which extends inside the instrument. This interior piece is not fully visible due to the reflective ""silvered"" surface of the glass which makes up the rest of the glass exterior (see correspondence addressed to Marse Bruce) . </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top cylinders extend down the first, and smaller, of two spheres, which is then connected to the larger, bottom, sphere by another glass cylinder.   A Maker's Mark is visible on the top of the second sphere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The entire glass structure is housed in a round wooden basket or box stuffed with newspaper and rags. Both the top and bottom rim  hold the bent wooden wall of the basket in shape. The wooden edges are fastened with rusted metal staples, perhaps iron. A straight metal fastener runs along the side of the basket to hold everything in place.</p>

Chappell, glassblower, University of Toronto",?1960s,"Documentation in the instrument's file states that the piece was donated by Reuben H. Chappell to the University of Toronto in 1991. Some of the correspondence regarding the donation is with Mr. Chappell's daughter, perhaps due to his age. The items donated by Mr. Chappell, and then his daughter, Mrs. Austen, were appraised and issued Charitable Gift Receipts.",,"The glass instrument was originally donated to the University of Toronto with the intent that it would be part of a museum of science and technology run by the University. According to documents and memos included in the instrument's record there were other pieces donated to the University along with this instrument, although further information could not be found. 

As there was no official museum in existence, the IHPST opted to set up display cases and exhibited some of the donated glass works there. A photograph included in the instrument's documents shows the apparatus leaning against the wall on the viewer's right. Other, unspecified, glass pieces are also displayed. A diagram of the instrument is also visible in the photograph, presumably explaining the purpose and use of the apparatus. The exact location of the display case is not known. No date of display is given, however, documented correspondence between Mr. Chappell and a Mr. M.P. Winsor gives an approximate date of April 1991. 

This instrument was originally thought to be a cryophorus. However, a letter addressed to the Editor of the University of Toronto Bulletin by Bruce Sinclair, who accepted the donation from Mr. Chappell, states that the instrument is not a cryophorus. The instrument is not given any other name or title beyond ""glass apparatus.""

According to documents within the  instrument's file Mr. Chappell had been employed by the University of Toronto since 1920 when he immigrated to Canada from England (?) after being offered the position of glassblower by the Physics Department. A letter addressed to Sir Robert A. Falconer, the President of the University of Toronto at the time, endorsed bringing Mr. Chappell over from England. Mr. Chappell retired in 1986, at the age of 90 after working as a glass blower for forty-four years in physics and moving to the metallurgy department for the remainder of his career. A document titled ""60 Years in Retrospect"" by Mr. Chappell, also included in the instrument's file, explains his experience at the University more in-depth and describes some of this research and glass blowing activities.

"Ferguson's Solar Chronometer","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The instrument is housed inside a rectangular wooden cover that can be attached to the measuring instrument base by two brass hook fasteners. The cover has a brass carrying-handle on the top. The box is handmade and is hinged together in five pieces using glue and in the style of dovetail hinging.<br />
The wooden base of the instrument has a brass plate in the centre with an engraving “No. 116 G Ferguson's Solar Chronometer”. The measuring instrument sits on a wooden base with a baize-covered rest, and is made almost entirely of German silver, save for the paper card inserted.<br />
The instrument itself is a curved half moon plate with struts across its horizontal diameter. There are also struts down the vertical radius. The instrument has the capability to adjust its position in accordance with latitude, which is measured by an internal latitude indicator suspended from one end of the struts. This is adjusted by a universal ball joint that moves freely and is controlled by a knob on the right hand side of the plate, which also locks the ball joint in place.<br />
The card hour plate inserted was probably printed using a lithograph printer and uses black and red for the colour scheme of the card. The card has a curved latitude scale across the width at its lowest point. A polar axis is marked on the frame above the latitude scale. The centre of the card is divided into two sections, the right representing east, and left, representing the west.<br />
This card shows the months June through December on the east and west vertical frames. On the top and bottom width frames of the card, Roman numerals are plotted out (left to right), from VII-XI on the west, and from I-V on the east.<br />
The hour-lines on the card are drawn vertically, but with a curve in order to provide a local mean time rather than a local solar time. The sun is meant to cast shadows upon the chart, and the point where the shadows intersect indicates the hour of the day, as well as the date.</p>

"Decorative Wine Decanter","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Decorative Wine Decanter is made of glass and is hand blown. It stands on a glass, tripod base about 3.4cm high. The object has two large bulbs, with a smaller fluted connection between them. At the top, there is a curved neck opening which is approximately 4.5cm high. Inside the decanter are three intertwining, solid tubes. Eight horizontal tubes run across the two bulbs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lower bulb has a circumference of 23cm and height of 9.7cm, while the middle passage way circumference is only 8.5cm and height of 5cm. The upper bulb is slightly smaller than the lower bulb, at only 9.5cm tall. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The base has delicate feet which sprout  helix/coils and extend to the top of the upper bulb. The helix in the centre is solid, extremely complex, intertwined, and cannot be accessed from inside the object. The only access to the inside of the flask is through the neck and is for pouring. The eight horizontal tubes running through the flask have the following lengths:<br />
Top Tube - 5cm<br />
2nd Tube - 5.7cm<br />
3rd Tube - 5cm<br />
4th Tube - 4.5cm<br />

"Box Illusion","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This instrument is trapezoidal in shape. Its sides are made of wood and are covered in green leather. The top of the object is Plexiglas and is held in place with screws and washers (3 on the right side, 5 on the left side). The lateral left side of the box is higher than the lateral right side, and as such the top angles down from left to right. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The anterior side of the box measures 50.5 cm high by 40.0 cm wide. It has a black plastic knob 5.0 cm above to the bottom of the object, a circular hole (diameter = 4.7 cm) 18.5 cm above the base, and a oval hole (height = 4.5 cm, width = 6.1 cm) 33.5 cm above the base. The round hole is located superior to and on the left of the plastic knob, while the oval hole is superior to both, and on their right. The holes allow the user to see inside the box.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The right lateral side of the box is the smallest of the four sides, measuring 42.8 cm high by 24.5 cm wide. The anterior edge is formed by the same board as the front, making it 50.5 cm high. There is a small metal clasp located on the posterior edge of this side, 27.0 cm from the base. It connects to the posterior side of the box to keep it closed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The posterior side of the box measures 42.8 cm in height on the left side and 50.0 in height on the right side. It is 50.3 cm in width. The left edge has been cut on an obtuse angle. The clasp that connects to the right side of the box is on this angled edge, not the posterior side proper. The clasp is fastened to the box with a single metal screw. There is also a large oval hole cut out on this side, measuring 2.6 cm high and 40.0 cm wide. It angles down from the left to the right. Inside of the hole there is a clear plastic ruler which measures to 38 cm. Beyond the ruler, some of the inner workings of the box can be seen. The posterior side opens outwards due to a hidden piano hinge on the right side. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The left lateral side of the box measures 50.8 cm high and 56.7 cm wide. There is a metal piano hinge on its posterior edge, held in place by 9 screws, which connects it to the posterior side. The hinge measures 45.8 cm high. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The superior portion of the inside back panel has two angled window outlines of different sizes painted on it in matte black paint. The medial window is much wider than the distal window. The windows are not painted on the wood itself, but instead on a sheet of thin but hard clear plastic. The plastic is glued to the superior edge of the panel. Under the plastic is a piece of white mat board. The bottom portion of the panel has been painted with matte black paint. The green leather from the outside of the box bends over the edges and is visible on the inside. The backside of the plastic ruler is visible here; it is held in place by two metal screws, one on each end.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The inside left panel is made of the same white mat board as the back panel. Another matte black painted window is painted on this wall, near the posterior edge. There is a black circle painted above the centre of the window.<br />
The inside anterior panel has been painted matte green. It is undecorated.<br />
The inside right panel is made of white mat board, and has a window outline painted on it in matte black paint, near the posterior edge. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two ‘floors’ on the inside of the box. The base of the box is painted green as well. The other floor is painted grey, and is superior to the first. It slopes down from the right side to the left, leaving a hollow space underneath. The floating floor is supported on its posterior edge by a piece of wood painted white. This board also slopes, connecting to the right side midway up the panel, and touching the left side at the base. At the distal ends of the white board, there is a white plastic spool held in place by a metal screw. There is a brown wooden spool midway along the board, inferior to the white spools. It is held in place by a plastic screw. A black cord runs around the plastic spools once each, and then several times around the wooden spool. The cord ends are tied to a small metal spring, which then attaches to a small metal clip closer to the left panel of the box. The clip then attaches to a rectangular black metal piece with two screws; the second screw has a thin metal bar descending from it. There is second metal clip identical to the first one, except that it is closer to the right panel of the box, and connects directly to the cord. The clips also attach to an aluminum bar that runs the length of the white board and appears to act as another stabilizer. The clips each hold a folded piece of white paper, which is blank on the posterior. On the anterior, each shows an identical black printed image of a standing man in a suit with a seated man and a seated woman pointed their left arms upwards at the standing man. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the inside anterior panel in the empty space inferior to the floating floor, there is a wood block that supports the black plastic knob on the exterior anterior panel. A small hard plastic tube runs from the knob to the plastic screw in the centre of the wooden spool. The tube causes the cord to move as the black knob is turned, allowing the pieces of paper inside to move left-right along the length of the cord. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The object manual is included, as well as 4 small wooden circles on metal dowels. Each circle has a diameter of 3.9 cm, and is white on one side and black on the other. 2 of the dowels are 18.0 cm in height, and 2 are 15.0 cm in height. A manual for a ‘Hidden Chair Illusion’ made by the same manufacturer was also found inside the object.</p>

As for its exact use for astronomy, this is unknown, yet it is a useful optical device to aid artists and scientists in ‘realistic’ drawings prior to the mainstream adoption of photography.  Presumably, it allowed an astronomer to sketch figures/models of celestial objects.  By choosing the appropriate concave or convex lens, the object being transcribed is enlarged/reduced/reflected through a superimposition on the drawing surface – thus, enabling the astronomer to see both the object/scene and the drawing surface at once.","Good: able to be used and moved around without damage

<p>2. The second portion is the tabletop, which sits centred on top of the base. This portion is rectangular shaped with a flat surface. Attached to the distal surface of the tabletop are two drawer-like components. One is is aligned with the left lateral edge of the tabletop and the other is aligned with the right lateral edge. They are drawer-like because each side is panelled, creating an enclosure. The one that is attached on the left lateral of the tabletop does not seem to function as anything, as it cannot be opened. The one on the right lateral has a miniature toggle switch that is located near the centre-right of the anterior panel. Directly to the left of the toggle switch is a small lightbulb that has a circular-shaped red-plastic case overtop of it. Centred on the posterior panel of the same drawer-like component is the entrance of the device's power cord. The cord is relatively long, with a distal portion that is very similar to a YY-3/ST3 plug. Directly to the right of the cord entrance, on the posterior panel, there is a label that says: 11OV. 60 HZ, 2 AMPERES, Imperial Optical.</p>

<p>3. The third component is the desktop. This portion has two purposes: to provide space and a surface for the physician to draw on and to provide support for the patient and hemisphere. Compared to the tabletop, the desk top is closer to a square in shape and is smaller, sitting centred on the tabletop. Unlike the tabletop, this component does not have a flat surface, but is angled so that the posterior side is double in height compared to the anterior side. All four sides are have panels, which turns the desktop component into a container, with a hollow center.  In the centre of the anterior-distal edge of this component, there is a rectangular gap that reveals the space inside of the desktop. Extending outward from the centre of the opening is a flat, long and narrow piece of metal that sits parallel to the tabletop surface beneath it. On it's anterior-distal end is a knurled control knob that can be spun clockwise and counter clockwise. On the posterior surface there is a sheet of metal that is screwed to the top of the proximal edge, making the proximal wall of the desktop much taller. It is on this addition that that the hemisphere is attached. On the same side, there is a tall, narrow, metal cylindrical object that is attached centrally to the distal portion of the desktop. The distal surface of this cylinder rests flat on the surface of the tabletop. The height of the proximal portion of this object reaches halfway up the hemisphere, aligning its height with the position of the aperture located in the centre of the hemisphere. Attached to the proximal portion of the cylinder is a plastic object that looks like a bowl that has been cut in half only the coronal plane. It is in this small holder where the patient would rest their chin. </p>

<p>Colour: The entire desk is covered in a layer of silver paint. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second main portion of this device is the Hemisphere, which is made of one solid piece.  The hemisphere may also be called the Bowl, because it looks exactly like a bowl. The difference is that rather than sitting flat on its base, it sits perpendicular, balancing on it’s rim, with the convex side facing anteriorly and the concave side facing posteriorly. To remain upright, the distal edge of the hemisphere is screwed into the posterior, proximal portion of the desktop.<br />
On the anterior surface of the hemisphere the meridians and the parallels of the field of vision are engraved. Along the outer edges of the anterior surface are the numbers, which begin where 12 would be indicated on a clock, moving clockwise around the hemisphere are the numbers: 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 195, 210, 225, 315, 335, 340, 0, 10, 35, 40, 60, and 75.  There are black lines that start from each of these numbers and move toward the centre of the of the hemisphere where there is a very small aperture. The are more number found along the lines that run along the sagittal and transverse planes, which read 10 , 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.<br />
The posterior surface of the hemisphere is blank. There are no numbers or lines; there is only the same aperture found in the centre of the convex. </p>

2. There is a label located in the centre of the posterior surface of the right lateral drawer-like component of the desk. The label says: ""11OV. 60 HZ, 2 AMPERES, Imperial Optical."" 
3. There is a makers mark located in the centre of the anterior surface of the table-top portion of the desk. It says “Gambs France” in black ink.","Length = 38, Width = 63, Height = 144","A Visual Field Test is a medical examination that tests  how well an individuals central and peripheral vision are functioning. If the test discovers that your peripheral vision has a dysfunction, it could be due to a stroke, glaucoma, brain tumour, etc.  

Perimetry is systematic method for performing a Visual Field Test.  There are two main types of perimetry: kinetic and automated. The Gambs perimeter uses manual kinetic perimetry, meaning the stimulus moves and it is moved by the physician's hand, rather than by a computer.  For more information, see Schiefer article in reference section. 

According to Marie Gambs, in her patent description (see in reference section), ""perimeters are instruments used for the examination of the visual field of a patient and for the recording of the results obtained on diagrams."" This specific perimeter is performed by projecting a luminous test-spot inside the hemisphere and shifting it in order to find the positions that can be perceived by the patient, who is looking at the 'pole' within the hemisphere. For more detailed information, please see “Understanding Visual Fields, Part I; Goldmann Perimetry” in the reference section.","As noted in the condition report, this device is in relatively good condition apart from a few minor problems. The hemisphere component of the device is quite dirty, which could be a result of poor storage practices. On the anterior side of the device, there are multiple markings, that looks like they have been made by the Physician using a marker of some kind. On the posterior side of the device, there is dirt smeared across the centre of the Hemisphere.
The toggle switch found on the anterior surface of the right lateral drawer-like portion of the desk seems to have been pushed into the inside of the desk, which needs to be pulled back out and secured in place. There is a thin metal plate on the distal end of the power cord that has come loose and must be put back in place and secured.

“The bubble sextant you're working with, and its mates, are a WWII-era design, and were probably manufactured in the period 1938-1943. Useful references to teaching navigation and using bubble sextants can be found in some contemporary (or near-contemporary) publications by Dept. members:

""'During the war [WWII] Dr. Hogg taught classes in Air Navigation, and invented a two-star sextant intended to simplify astronomical navigation...'; John F. Heard, ""Frank Scott Hogg, 1904-1951"", Popular Astronomy 59, 4 (April, 1951), 173-175, at p. 174.

""'[p. 249] During World War II there was considerable interest in air navigation among astronomers, both professional and amateur. In fact, a good deal of reliance was placed upon those with astronomical training for the development and operation of training systems for air navigators. This was a natural outgrowth of the traditional position of navigation as a branch of applied astronomy... [p. 250] Aside from recourse to recognition of ground features, the pre-war and early-war navigator had the bubble sextant... Fixing position by sextant (""astro"") was limited to night operation, to clear sky, and it required more skill and confidence than many navigators possessed. Yet. it was self-contained [i.e., not subject to enemy interference]... [p. 254]... Astro [i.e., use of a sextant] as an aid has had a chequered career of ups and downs in air navigation. At the end of the war [1945] it seemed completely obsolete, a victim of... radar. Since the war there has been a revival of interest in astro, sparked by the greater ease and accuracy offered by the new periscopic sextants...'; John F. Heard, ""Air Navigation Since World War II"", Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, 51, 4 (1957), 249-255.

""Frank Hogg was Head of the Dept. and Director of the David Dunlap Observatory (DDO; 1946-1951), and he designed a new bubble sextant for war use, but it never went into production (your sextant is not one of his - I'm not even sure the Dept.'s collection includes a Hogg sextant; Lee and I will have to check on that - only four prototypes were made at the DDO shops). And your bubble sextant is not of the periscopic type, a fact which provides a very rough terminus ante quem for the artifact. Jack Heard (1907-1976) was head of the Dept. and Director of the DDO (1952-1965) after Frank Hogg's death. Heard, who became a RCAF Squadron Leader, taught air navigation during WWII, but apparently not at the Dept./DDO. Another staff member at the time, Peter M. Millman (1906-1990), enjoyed an nearly identicial war-time career.

""So, the above establishes that DDO personel were experienced in air navigation, designed and used bubble sextants, and taught their use. What it doesn't tell us is whether any of the teaching actually happened at the DDO or the Dept. (i.e., physically at U. of T.), and when and how the WWII bubble sextants entered the collection. If you don't find any other evidence, I think you're safe in saying that the instruments date to the period 1938-1943, and you can argue that since they are presently in the collection, and that members of the DDO taught wartime air navigation, and that there are multiple numbers of bubble sextants in the collection (suggesting a teaching collection), the bubble sextants were probably used by members of the Dept. during the war years (note the qualifications to the statements). It is of course possible the bubble sextants, having been judged antiquated by the military immediately after the war, came into the possession of one or more of the astronomer airmen of the Dept., who then brought them as surplus to the Dept. with the intention of employing them in introductory astronomy classes post-war, to teach some aspects of practical (i.e., positional) astronomy. While a possibility, I have no evidence the latter scenario actually happened. Christine Clement may know more about the instruments' post-war use, if any, and Lee could put you in contact with her.”

The introduction of commercial transoceanic flights in the mid-1930s, together with growing international unrest, led to increased attention to this technology. The military services purchased large numbers of these instruments in the early years of World War II, and again during the Cold War, as did commercial airlines in the post war period. 
A normal sextant is unsuitable for use in an aircraft because the horizon is not level with the observer as in a ship, so the bubble sextant was developed for aeronautical use in the 1920s. It was very important in WWII. The automatic averaging attachment was meant to ensure that unbiassed measurements were made while the bubble and observer wobbled randomly, so that the error would reduce as the square root of the number of observations. Sixty measurements were averaged as the observer tried to keep the bubble and a star in coincidence for a two minute period.

<p>2014.ep.6.a: The EAI 6250 is a rectangular device which was designed to sit on the analog computer. It is held in place by magnetic force. The aluminum frame is a dark, dull grey colour, and the face of the machine is a slightly lighter shade. The front of the instrument has a red light, labelled ‘OVERLOAD’, directly adjacent to a display screen that operates using nixie tube technology. There are two dials on the front of the instrument; one to adjust the display and the other to adjust calibration from zero to ±1000. A series of three switches is found between the dials. The red switch, labelled ‘CAL’, is set apart from two black switches which are labelled by voltage (1V or 10V). The power source and connector outlet are located on the reverse of the machine. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2014.ep.6.b: The EAI TR-20 is a large and heavy rectangular unit. It is freestanding in a vertical, upright position. The aluminum frame is a dark grey. The rest of the machine is brightly coloured with yellow, green, red, orange, and brown to identify different mechanical components. The row of dials at the top of the machine represent 20 potentiometers which are controlled by the turn-counting dials to alter the voltage. Below the potentiometers, there is a row of coefficient attenuators; a row of integrator networks, multipliers, and comparators; and a row of amplifiers. The d-c operational amplifier is considered the basic component of an analog computer, and this model is supposed to possess 20 amplifiers. Blue and black 'bottle-plug' wires are used to patch the cover plate to the face panel beneath it. The cover plate is removable for programming, and interchangeable with a spare cover plate. The control panel is below the face panel. The control panel has a voltmeter range switch, voltmeter function switch, mode control switch, a null pot reference selector switch, and a display screen to measure gains from zero to 10, positive or negative. The switches are all black in colour, and round in shape. Certain switches on the control panel were unable to be identified with an appropriate degree of certainty. According to its manual, the computer has gold-plated contact springs. The contact springs are visible on the back of the instrument where there is extensive plastic-coated, copper wiring that is grouped by colour (yellow, orange, green, red, white, purple, and blue). Some wires are encased in a burlap fabric that is tan in colour. The power supply comes from an electrical port on the reverse of the machine.</p>

The machine was in place to monitor the intensity of the voltages in case of an overload which would be alerted by a red flashing light. 

The EAI TR-20 was intended to be a general purpose machine. Its core function was to alter data in real time in order to solve both linear and non-linear differential equations more quickly than the average human operator. The continuous variables of the equations were based off of direct current voltages that were controlled by the electric circuitry within the machine. The system was capable of summation, multiplication, subtraction, division, generation of a function, and integration of a variable with limited accuracy. The TR-20 has been used in experimentation to simulate a pendulum, the rate of trajectory and radioactive decay.

"Keyless Pocket Chronometer","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This round open face keyless pocket chronometer has a timepiece that is set within a reddish-brown smooth and oxidized silver base. Located at the top-centre of the instrument is a ring that surrounds a ridged winding piece. To the left is a push piece that opens two separate hinged bezels (please note that the secondary cuvette, that encloses the inner-mechanics of the instrument, is stuck). The other hinged bezel pops open to reveal a silver cuvette that is inscribed with various subtle markings, including a crowns, two lions, various initials, and numbers (described in the markings section). The main dial on the face of the instrument is numbered by 5’s from 5-60. It is hand painted in black on a pristine white enamel surface which contains three sunken subsidiary dials along the lower half. The upper-right dial is numbered from 0-23 with a small pointed blackened steel hand. The smaller dial, located in the lower-centre, contains a narrow rose-gold hand, and is numbered in 10’s from 10-60. The upper-left dial contains a 12-hour Roman Numeral chapter and contains a gold-plated pointed hand. One large gold-plated/gold-filled hand with applied sun on point as well as one large blued-steel hand with a rounded half-moon on point are secured in centre of clock plate. The large blued-steel hand is pointing towards 41 and the gold-plated/gold-filled hand is pointing slightly below 48.</p>

Chronometers are “timepiece[s] with a nearly constant rate, intended primarily for the determination of longitude by comparing local time, computed by celestial or satellite navigation, with time at the prime meridian measured by a clock” (Oxford Reference 2013). The function of this particular make is to measure sidereal and mean time, typically during sea voyages. Sidereal time is a “system based on the rotation of the Earth measured relative to the background stars, which for this purpose are regarded as fixed in position” (Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics 2001). Mean Solar Time is a “system in use for most civil and many astronomical purposes and based on the motion of a hypothetical object called the mean Sun, the right ascension of which increases from day to day at a uniform rate. The local mean time is defined to be the local hour angle of the mean Sun plus 12h” (Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics 2001).

"Rutherford Electroscope","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The instrument consists of two separable black metal boxes stacked one upon the other, with an arm attached to the bottom box holding a microscope. The bottom box contains a stand with an adjustable pedestal on a plate which slides out of the box through a side door.  The top box has two parallel glass windows on opposite sides and another side composed of aluminum foil. Attached to the roof of the top box is a metal rod attached to a gold leaf (missing). The rod touches a contact, which can be controlled by a lever on the top of the box. There is a copper mesh grate on the top of the bottom box.</p>

<p>Large, green metal equipment backpack with thick green straps woven and sewn together that are attached to the metal component with rope ties. The two main vertical straps are intended to pass over a person's shoulders in order to carry the backpack easily and an additional strap with a leather component can pass over a person's head to perhaps allow them to brace the strap on their chest. There are metal buckles and rings attached to the straps, allowing them to be adjusted. A wooden, platform-like component is attached to the bottom of the backpack with a combination of rope and metal screws. A dark blue ink stamp on the woven straps provides some provenance information (see ""Markings""). The metal plank component of the backpack has three large holes down its center with 8 smaller holes along the side through which additional rope or cords could be passed to further secure equipment.</p>

""Phthalocyanine and Boron Subphthalocyanine Compounds
Phthalocyanine (Pc) and boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) compounds are currently being researched by Professor Tim Bender's group in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry at the University of Toronto. The molecular structures of these compounds and their derivatives exhibit unique physical properties in terms of their ability to absorb light and conduct electricity. These compounds are used in organic electronics, such as organic solar cells (which produce electricity from sunlight) and organic light-emitting diodes (which
produce light from electricity). Although Pcs and BsubPcs have remarkably similar structures, their slight molecular differences result in the human eye perceiving two very different colours. Pcs have a planar (flat) structure and are perceived as a bright blue-green. On the other hand, BsubPcs are bowl-shaped resulting in the perception of a bright magenta colour. While the powdered forms of these samples will maintain their brilliance over long periods of time, solutions made by dissolving the compounds in an organic solvent will lose their colour more quickly. 

Phthalocyanine (Pc) was first synthesized in 1907, though at the time it was reported as an unidentified blue compound. In 1927, Swiss and Scottish researchers both independently synthesized copper phthalocyanine and by the mid-1930’s it was developed as a commercial pigment. Pcs bind with nearly all metal elements of the periodic table, with the metal atom sitting in the cavity at the center of the molecule. Most of these Pc compounds exhibit brilliant shades of colour, making them ideal colourants or dyes. In fact, about 25% of all artificial organic pigments are Pc derivatives. Professor Bender's group in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry at the University of Toronto is currently studying Pc derivatives for use in organic solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes. 

BsubPC Compound
Boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) was accidentally synthesized in 1972 while scientists were attempting to make a version of Pc containing a boron atom in the center. Scientists were surprised by its unique pink-purple colour and cone-shaped molecular centre, yet no further work on the compound was published until 1990. BsubPcs exhibit unique optical properties and can withstand high temperatures (over 300°C), making them ideal for optical applications.

These compounds and their derivatives are currently being used in organic electronics, including organic LED’s (light-emitting diodes) and semiconductors.
Graduate students working with Professor Bender in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry at the University of Toronto are heavily involved in this cutting-edge technology. While Pc compounds are renowned for their brilliant colours and are widely used as colourants, BsubPcs are less stable in sunlight and a more chemically stable derivative must be established before using its pink-purple shades in commercial dyeing. BsubPc in its crystallized state turns from a pink-purple colour to a metallic gold, further illustrating how changing molecular arrangements drastically affects what colour the eye perceives.",UTSIC,Storage,"Victoria Fisher",1,1,2015-09-23,2015-09-23,,,,,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/?post_type=wpm_instrument&p=7503,draft

"De Fonbrune Micromanipulator","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The artefact consists of two principal components, the micromanipulator (1) mechanism and the controller (2). The two are joined by three pieces of narrow tubing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1) The micromanipulator mechanism is a sturdy metal object with a clear plastic cover. The metal frame is finished in black. In place of a microtool, two elements--a metal holder retaining a plastic tube--protrude from the front. Several knurled adjusting knobs protrude from the metal stand beneath the plastic cover. Beneath the plastic cover lie the pneumatic micromanipulator mechanisms. These are ""deformable capsules"" (capsules déformable) that mechanically actuate the tool tips via metal arms. A small cylindrical piece--a suplementary tool holder--is attached to the front part of the piece outside the plastic cover.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The micromanipulator mechanism is secured to a metal and glass base that likely was not originally part of the instrument. It is attached to the glass surface of the base with a rubber-like adhesive. This base permits the orientation of the micromanipulator mechanism to be adjusted along a downward arc. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2) The controller (récepteur) resembles a joystick and is mounted on a sturdy metal base with the same black finish and the micromanipulator mechanism. The travel of the handle is bounded by a circular frame that has a silver finish. The controller incorporates three pistons that actuate the microtool along the x, y, and z axes respectively. These pistons are connected to the deformable capsules via narrow clear tubes.</p>

The first prototype instrument was demonstrated in 1932. The instrument was perfected between 1936 and 1938 with the assistance of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and the instrument makers Paul Beaudouin and Henri Gondet. This history is briefly described in the introduction to [de Fonbrune,1949]. 

Paul Beaudouin was the nephew of Charles Beaudouin, who had first established a Paris-based instrument manufacturing enterprise around 1914. 

The instrument was ani mprovement over earlier micromanipulators in the sense that the controller permitted easy and intuitive control across three axes. For instance, the  &amp;lt;a href="" https://utsic.escalator.utoronto.ca/home/blog/instrument/chambers-micromanipulator/""&amp;gt;Chambers' Micromanipulator&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, developed around 1918, required that each axis be controlled separately using an adjustment screw.

De Fonbrune and his colleagues at the Institut Pasteur developed a number of related technologies, including a specialized microforge for creating various glass microtools and an oil-based moist chamber that prevented evaporation of the suspension liquid when working with organic samples.",,,,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/?post_type=wpm_instrument&p=8616,draft

""The Grason-Stadler Series 1200 Solid State Programming System is designed for control of complex experiment parameters and for versatile data acquisition functions. Although initially developed for psychological research, the system recently has been expanded to include a series of analog devices which generate, control and monitor auditory stimulus parameters. Because of its relatively high speed and functional design, the system is well suited for any application requiring control of electrical devices as the result of complex and often brief relationships to the state of other devices. Input to the system typically consists of ontact operations, analog waveforms or logic signals. These inputs are converted, stored, counted, timed and otherwise manipulated, then used to generate output events. The latter typically consist of voltage levels or contact operations that can be used to operate virtually any device that submits to electrical control.

The Grason-Stadler Solid State System recommends itself for a variety of reasons. First, its construction is modular, i.e., the system is made up of discrete programming units, each packages for easy inclusion in or exclusion from a system. Beginning with a few basic modules, or one of the convenient package systems, a user can automate simple experiment requirements.As requirements increase, the capability of the system itself can be increased through the addition of new units. 

Second the system employs a functional design. Each discrete programming unit performs one complete programming function, such as counting, timing, gating, stepping or sensing. Because such functional packaging and design permits the system to be utilized by even relatively naive programmers, a minimum amount of time is required to learn how to operate the system. 

Third, the system permits control contingencies to be set up through easily changeable front panel connections or through a central control panel. The latter permits complex programs to be made up in advance, stored until needed, and then installed and made operational in a few minutes. 

Finally, the Series 1200 System includes a wide variety of programming units- digital and analog - not ordinarily found in a single system. The mechanical and electrical compatibility of these two types of units permits audiological tests such as SIS, ABLB, fixed-frequency Bekesy and psychoacoustic techniques such as multi-alternative forced-choice, click localization, backward and forward masking, and PEST. Heretofore, such control of auditory waveforms has been possible only through the assemblage of a variety of manufacturer's instruments.""",,,"Grason-Stadler Instruments for Psychology and Acoustics",1960s-1970s?,"Prof. Paul Milgram, Engineering Psychology, U of T",,"The device's accompanying documents include installation and operating instructions for the various modules of the system, a purchase catalog from 1968 with suggested packages for use, a general Grason-Stadler product catalogue from 1973, as well as various Grason-Stadler brochures.

On the sides are slits that expose the inside of the box to air outside of the box. An extension plug comes out of the back of the instrument, but instead of a typical plug for a wall outlet, there is a long plug that appears to be a positive cable that plugs into an electrical sound amplifier.</p>

Rustrak's three types of recorders: galvanometric, event and servo record data by making an impression on pressure sensitive chart paper. Recording occurs on the galvanometric models when the exclusive patented Rustrak mechanical Striker bar presses the stylus against the chart. This action initiates a dot printing at a rate depending on the chart drive motor chosen. The servo and event recorder styli are in direct contact with the chart paper at all times for quiet and continuous recording. The small compact size makes the Rustrak the ideal choice for both portable applications and for areas where space is limited. Recorders can be packaged in one or two configurations and can be supplied with fixed ranges, dedicated to a particular recording task, or with plug-in signal conditioners on servo recorders for more flexibility. For even greater versatility, add other options. Applications for the world's most versatile recorder are limited only by the imagination.""

As a thermometer, the metallic helix, a bimetallic strip, expands and contracts with the temperature, turning the needle. 

As a galvanometer, a small quantity of mercury can be put in the small bowl at the base of the helix. The tiny metallic strip danging into the bowl contacts the mercury enabling an electrical circuit to be run through the helix. The resistivity of the helix causes a change in temperature, thus allowing measurement of the intensity of the current.","Excellent. The superficial surface condition of the thermometer and its internal components is excellent, aside from some dust and a few marks on the glass dome. The helix is somewhat misshapen, possibly from repeated use. 

The bowl at the base of the helix is silver, possibly from contact with mercury.",,"Breguet, Paris",1886,"This Bréguet’s thermometer was purchased by the University of Toronto Department of Mathematics and Physics in 1886, by professor James Loudon through his Paris contact instrument maker Rudolph Koenig.

Concerning his alterations, de la Rive wrote:

""J'ai trouvé que, lorsqu'il s'agissait de courans peu intenses, l'appareil precedent n'etait pas sensible. Je l'ai donc remplace avec beaucoup d'avantage dans ce cas, par celiu qui est represente a la fig. 13. C'est un thermometre metallique de Breguet, auquel j'ai fait subir queles legeres modifications pour l'adapter au but que je me proposais. 

Il s'agit de faire passer le courant dont on veut etudier l'intensite calorifique, dans l'helice metallique dont les changemens de forme resultant des legeres differences de temperature sont accuses par les degres que parcourt sur unde division circulaie, une aiguille horizontale librement suspendue a l'extrimite inferiere de cette helice. On sait que les degres parcourus par l'aiguille son directement proportionnels aux temperatures auxquelles l'helice est exposee. Pour la mettre dans le circuit, j'ai ajoute a la tige metallique qui porte son extremite superieure un conducteur que l'on met en communication avec l'un des poles de la pile; l'autre pole aboutit au moyen d'un second conducteur, dans une capsule centrale remplie de mercure ou plonge legerement, de maniere qu le frottement soit le moindre possible, un fil fin de platine adapte verticalement a l'extremite inferieure et mobile de l'helice. De cette maniere celle-ci peut etre traversee par un courant quel conque sans etre genee dans les mouvements et dans les changemetns de forme qu'elle  doit eprouver en vertue des changemens de temperature.""",UTSIC,"In storage","Victoria Fisher",1,0,2017-10-13,2017-10-13,,,,,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/?post_type=wpm_instrument&p=10779,draft

In 1937 Carl Kübler, whose German firm made the famous Addiator adder, filed a U.S. patent application for attaching an adder to a metal slide rule. By the 1950s, an unknown company in Japan made ""personal calculators"" (such as 1992.0548.01) and sometimes attached slide rules. In 1968 Al Nyman &amp;amp; Son, Inc., of New York, N.Y., took out a trademark for ""alco"" for drawing compasses and pocket calculators (serial number 72278404). Perhaps the firm distributed this instrument, although the style of ""alco"" in the trademark does not match the mark on the object.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This instrument consists of an exterior frame (Part I), an interior mechanism (Part II), and a base (Part III).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part I - Outer Frame:<br />
The instrument consists of an upright, cylindrical outer frame constructed of metal (possibly steel or iron). The frame is composed of four thin metal support pillars which are soldered to two circular metal rings, one ring attached to the posterior of the support pillars and one ring attached to the anterior of the support pillars, forming an open, cylindrical frame. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part II - Interior Mechanism:<br />
A mechanism is soldered to the interior of the cylindrical outer frame at four different points: Two of the frame's metal pillars are soldered at their center to both lateral edges of disk A of the interior mechanism. Another metal pillar is divided into two parts, one half soldered to the frame's anterior metal ring and the anterior edge of disk A. The second half of the pillar is then soldered to the posterior edge of disk A and to the posterior metal ring of the frame. The frame's fourth support pillar is not attached to the interior mechanism, soldered only to the anterior and posterior metal rings of the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attached between the two vertical metal arms of B is a circular metal disk labelled A.  Each vertical arm of B is soldered to each face of disk A in the center of disk A. On each face of the disk, there are raised concentric circular ridges in the metal. Below disk A, the posterior ends of each arm of B are joined at right angles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attached to one side of the interior of the instrument's frame is vertical metal bar H. Attached to the outside bar H is vertical bar M, made of German silver. A horizontal steel point known as a ""pen"" and labelled L is attached to vertical bar H and extends diagonally upward. Horizontal lever DCF supports a second pen labelled E, which extends horizontally.  A small rectangular metal plate is attached at the top of bar B and sits behind pens E and L, whose points touch the surface of the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part III - Base:<br />
The outer frame and the interior mechanism attached to the frame sit atop a circular metal base (possibly copper). The cylindrical frame is not attached to the base and can be removed. The base is circular and has concentric circular ridges on both its anterior and posterior faces. In the center of the base's anterior face is a raised cylindrical clamp which can be loosened or tightened by a screw protruding horizontally from the side of the clamp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note: the base of the instrument is not represented in the attached diagram.</p>

Heliostat,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This instrument consists of a one-sided flat mirror, two arms, a central support, a head device and base. Mounted to a semi-circular steel bar, the mirror is able to rotate in all directions and has an iron rod attached. The mirror's arm is then fastened to a vertical and central brass post, which supports an intricate head piece. The post is attached to a flat brass round base, with three levelling screw legs. Marked on the top of the base is the inscription “R FUESS STEGLITZ-BERLIN”. The head piece is able to rotate a set amount of degrees and carries a small steel arm. Two protractor dials provide precision angular adjustment of the head. One protractor is located directly on the top-face of the head, while the second takes the form of a cradle support below. A cylindrical clockwork mechanism, with key attached, partially controls the fine-tuning. A screw below the protractor support also allows for detailed adjustments.</p>

<p>This instrument consists of two metal rectangles, welded to each other in an L shape. The Level Recorder acts as the base of the instrument, positioned below the Frequency Analyzer. The instrument's main colours are black (sides, top, and back) and pale green (main interface on both rectangles). The instrument is very heavy. The Level Recorder is 53 lbs (Megawavz, 2014), but exact weight of the entire instrument is not known at this time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Level Recorder: The Level Recorder is a rectangle shape with the bottom right one quarter of it purposefully cut out to make room for a pre-printed frequency calibrated paper roll. It has 7 adjacent medium-sized black dials on its main interface and 2 medium-sized adjacent black dials along the anterior side. The main interface has 4 small black switches (3 on the left side and 1 on the right) and one voltage input on the right side. The anterior side has 2 adjacent silver inputs. The right lateral side has 8 black inputs. The left lateral side is smooth with no markings, dials, switches, or inputs. The posterior side of the Level Recorder is hollow and wiring is visible underneath the instrument. The pre-printed frequency calibrated paper roll consists of graph paper and it is rolled around a metal arm that has the capacity to spin around. On the anterior side, the manufactured marking ""LEVEL RECORDER TYPE 2307"" is visible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frequency Analyzer: The Frequency Analyzer is a rectangle shape and is welded above the Level Recorder. The left side of the main interface consists of 2 small black dials and 2 silver inputs in a vertical column, with a larger black dial to the right of the column. The centre of the main interface has two rectangles with a white background and black border, with one marked ""Sound Level"" positioned above the other. Both rectangles show are covered in transparent plastic and show a scale of measurements with a needle that would have the capacity to move along the scale when the instrument is operational. Between the rectangles are 14 black, small, rectangular buttons, split evenly with 7 buttons on the left and 7 buttons on the right of the main interface. Below the rectangles are 8 black, small, rectangular buttons, split evenly with 4 buttons on the left and 4 buttons on the right of the main interface. Centered below these buttons is a medium sized, black dial. On the right side of the main interface, there are 2 small black dials, 1 silver output with a black rubber cord plugged into it. Beside this output is a small black switch, and below the output is a large black dial. The posterior side of the Frequency Analyzer has a large grated rectangle situated above a blue and white manufacturer's tag. Centered on the main interface below the uppermost white rectangle, the manufactured marking ""FREQUENCY ANALYZER TYPE 2120"" is visible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cords: the instrument has 2 cords. One cord is plugged into an output on the right side of the Frequency Analyzer, and one cord is loose (laying on the instrument). The cord that is plugged in is black with a silver tip (plugged in) and the other end has 2 silver prongs. The cord that is loose is black and seems to have 2 ""male"" ends - one end has a silver prong and the other has 14 pins (resembles a VGA plug). There are more cords beneath the instrument in the hollow posterior of the Level Recorder.</p>

Printed in 1974.

Level Recorder: Type 2305 and 2307 Level Recorders are designed for the accurate recording of signal levels in the frequency range from 2 Hz to 200 kHz as well as for the recording of DC (Direct Current) signals. The two recorders are based on the same working principle, the type 2307 including several features offering easier operation and greater versatility than Type 2305. Levels may be recorded as a function of time using lined paper or as a function of frequency, in conjunction with one of the B&amp;amp;K Beat Frequency Oscillators or Frequency Analyzers, using frequency calibrated paper. Type 2307 furthermore features possibility for the control of the paper drive movement in both directions by means of an external DC voltage. It can thus be used to record the relationship between two varying voltages. Recordings on both recorders can be made by means of ink or by means of a sapphire stylus writing on wax-coated paper. 

Frequency Analyzer: Type 2120 Frequency Analyzer is a frequency selective, high gain measuring amplifier, continuously tunable through the frequency range of 2 Hz to 20 kHz, in eight subranges. Automatic recording of frequency analyses can be made on preprinted frequency calibrated paper when the analyzer is connected via a flexible shaft to Level Recorder Type 2305 or 2307. Used with a condenser microphone and preamplifier the instrument fulfils the IEC R179 for precision sound level meters and the proposed standard for impulse sound level meters.

The Frequency Analyzer and Level Recorder were acquired from Professor Paul Milgram of the University of Toronto Engineering Psychology Dept. Milgram writes that the instruments were purchased and used by (the late) Professor Patrick J. Foley. Milgram writes, ""I don’t know whether he ever used the equipment for research purposes. I do know that he used these devices for demonstrating various measurement techniques to his Human Factors classes."" (Professor Paul Milgram, e-mail communication, March 2014).","The instrument is in very good condition with no major signs of wear and tear. There is one small spot of oxidized/tarnished material toward the left side of the main interface on the Level Recorder. It seems to be isolated and not spreading. Otherwise, the instrument is mainly just dusty and dirty all over. The instrument is rather heavy (exact weight of entire instrument unknown) but is very sturdy and could be moved around safely on a dolly. Dial and switch labels are very legible. 

?If there are supposed to be plugs for each input/output, the instrument could be missing a number of cords (such as pre-amp input, direct input, input max, ground cord, x input, com switch, remote control recorder and filter, ext filter input and output, volt. cal, fuse 5A, battery input, drive shaft I and drive shaft II)

At the time this record was created (March 2014), the functionality of the instrument was not tested by the cataloguer. It is not known whether or not the instrument is capable of turning on, and it is not known if it still measures sound properly.",n/a,"Brüel &amp;amp; Kjær (specifically the Bruel and Kjaer Canada branch)","ca. 1970s","Originally purchased on September 8, 1978 by (the late) Professor Patrick J.

Microscope,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a large brass microscope with a large quantity of accessories contained inside a wooden case. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The case is rectangular and quite tall. At the front it has a door hinged on the right, with a keyhole and lock on one side. The top and base of the case are slightly broader than the body. There are metal carrying handles on either side of the case. The microscope sits on a wooden plate which has indented rectangular cuts lined with dark blue velvet for its feet. There are rotating wooden wedges that can be slid over the fit to secure the instrument to the plate. The microscope is removed from the case by sliding out this wooden base. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of the components of the microscope are made of brass. The stand consists of a vertical metal tube with two legs on either side of it. These are fitted into the feet, which curve outwards to provide stability. At the top of this stand, there is a horizontal arm that supports the eyepiece tubes. The arm and these tubes can be raised and lowered by turning a large knob on the side of the the stand. Behind the tube that supports the eyepiece tube there is a vertical knob with a scale around the edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eyepiece tubes sit in a supporting ring at the end of the horizontal arm and converge at the ring, just above objective lens of the microscope. One of these tubes is vertical; the other emerges at the base at an slight angle from the vertical tube. Both have their open top ends covered by cylindrical covers and have screw adjustment with ridged knob ends close to the top of the tubes. Turning either one of these knobs raises and lowers inner tubes inside the eyepiece ends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The objective lens sits just above the stage, which is consists of several metal plates on top of one another, with round or rectangular holes through the centre. These are supported at a slightly tilt towards the stand side of the instrument by brackets fixed to the stand of the instrument. The stage platform can be adjusted in two dimensions by screw knobs. Beneath the stage there is a round ring with a gear toothed circular top. This has three adjustment knobs around its rim. Beneath this, there is a semi-circular piece of metal attached to the central tube of the stand. This supports a circular mirror with a brass rim. The mirror is mirrored on both sides.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in the box are a number of other components. The majority of these components are stored in three wooden drawers in the top left of the box. One of the drawers contains six eyepieces and seven objective lenses. Each of the objectives are contained in a cylindrical case with a screw lid; all of these read ""A.F. POTTER"" and are engraved with different inch measurements, from 1/8 inch to 2 inches. Also in this drawer there is an eighth cylindrical container with a screw lid that reads ""ROTATING PRISM"", and three metal rods with small circular disks at the end. Each of the cases fits into a circular hole in a wooden support. There is one open hole that does not contain a case. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a second drawer, there are two cylindrical cases with screw lids that contain tubes with cup-shaped attachments on the end with reflective interiors. These are differently sized, and engraved with their inch sizing and the word ""LIEBERKUHN"" on the lid. Also in the drawer there is another cylindrical case labelled ""SELENITES"" containing two small transparent discs with metal rims; these are cushioned in their container by a piece of cotton fluff. In this drawer there are a number of other components, including a plate attached to a lens with a thin line through the middle, a metal plate with a circular hole in the middle, a lens with a prism in the centre and a magnifier attachment on one side, a simple round lens in a metal rim, a metal place with rotating ring attachments, and a metal plate with a circular hole through middle with a metal ring fitted over the open hole. Each of these is fitted into a wooden support or purpose-cut hole. In this drawer, there are two openings for cylindrical cases and some narrow slots that do not contain components.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A third drawer contains a number of metal tubes. Some of these are open tubes, and other have different ends at one end, including a transparent lens ring with an opaque centre, and a conical transparent endwith a central opaque tube. Also in this drawer there is a metal plate with a circular hole and lens at one end, a circular screw attachment with a rotating disk attached with holes of different apertures, and a spectroscopic prism eyepiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other components are stored in purpose-made wooden storage containers on the interior walls of the box. Objects contained in these include a round disk with a centre hole with screw threads inside, a magnifying lens on a t-shaped rod, a metal tube with a tooth-edged disk rim at one end with a scale around the edge, and a rotating vernier scale attached to this. Affixed in slots at the back of the case are two small rods, one of which is attached to a rectangular concave mirror. All of these components are made of brass.</p>

He was the son of Charles Potter, senior, and younger brother of Charles Potter, junior. Potter was trained in instrument making by his father in Britain. 19th century London was one of the main world centers for design and development of scientific instruments. After his training, &amp;lt;a href=""http://static.torontopubliclibrary.ca/da/pdfs/37131055351860d.pdf""&amp;gt;Potter moved to Toronto&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; where, after a short spell working with another British instrument maker, William Hearn, he opened a business as a scientific instrument maker alongside his brother Charles Potter Jr.. He and his brother Charles Jr. worked together from 1857-1860 but parted ways after Augustus charged Charles with theft. A.F. sold his business in 1865 and returned to London. Charles Potter remained in Toronto and continued working as an instrument maker.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This pillar supports a long wooden arm with curved end and tapered at each end. This is connected to the pillar at its broadest part, about a fifth of the way along, so that there is a short and long end. Running above the the long end there is a metal arm supported by a series of wooden pillars. A both ends, this broadens into circular sections which are open in the middle, forming a pair of rings. Inside both these rings is a ball located so its equator is roughly at the level of the metal piece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One ring, located above the central support pillar, contains a wooden ball supported by a wooden rod at the base. The other, at the far end of the long arm, contains a smaller ball made of an unknown material. This has a ring affixed to the equator of the ball and is inclined slightly, so the ring is at an angle to the metal arm. The ring is marked with different coloured concentric circles, indicating the different colours in the rings of a planet such as Saturn. This ball has a metal rod through its north and south poles, showing inclination. This ball is supported by a metal rod.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The supports of both balls stand on wooden pulley wheels. There is a third pulley wheel on the short end of the arm; this one has a metal knob with a knurled edge affixed to its top and centre. Connected these wheels is a length of string attached such that when the arm is rotated, the exterior ball, representing a planet, turns on its axis.</p>

"Eclipse Model","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a wooden model of the Earth, Moon and Sun system. The model stands on a square base with a thick wooden pillar rising from the centre of it. This supports a wooden arm at one end. The arm has narrow, curved ends and a broad middle and rotates around the central pillar. Mounted above this, supported by five wooden pillars, is a brass plate with curved ends and two central cut-out areas. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within one of the the cut-out sections of this plate is a larger wooden sphere (sitting directly over the main support pillar). At the distant end of the arm is a circular cut-out, containing a spoked brass circular disk that is inclined at an angle. At the centre of this there is a smaller brass sphere and on the rim of the spoked disk there is a very small white disk form of two hemispheres. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Underneath the wooden board is a (wooden) gear and pulley system linked by a cotton strong, connecting the spoked disc to the inner wooden sphere causing the outer sphere to rotate on its own axis as the board is rotated around the central stand. The radial length of the pulley system can adjusted by moving an underside gear on the end of the arm opposite to the small brass sphere, changing its rotation period.</p>

<p>The instrument stands on a tripod of metal rods acting as feet. Two of these have screw threads around the circumference and are adjustable. Next to these, emerging from the base of the instrument, there is a knurled tube attachment sticking out horizontally. Above this is a triangular plate and above that then a circular plate, both mounted horizontally. The circular plate is graduated in 360 degrees around the rim. Sticking out from this circle there is a rectangular horizontal protrustion inset with perpendicular horizontal levels. This reads ""TRUE COURSE"" with an indicator arrow. This protrusion can be turned manually, turning the whole top section of the instrument.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above this, mounted between two supports, there is a pair of cylindrical disks mounted horizontal on top of one another. A knob wheel turns both the top of the upper disk and the bottom of the lower disk at the same time, in the same dirction. The bottom, graduated in red is labeled ""L.H.A. SOUTH""; the top, graduate in white, ""L.H.A NORTH"". Another small silver ridged wheel that can be moved by turning a knob is labelled ""LAT."" Mounted by a bracket on top of the pair of disks is a tilting platform with a line through the centre of it that runs to small gaps in the plastic ends. This can be tilted on a scale marked in degrees. This piece is marked ""DECLINATION"".</p>

Unknown,"This is a metal cone, painted in black both inside and outside. At its narrow end, it has a round opening with a screw exterior. At its broad end, it bends to form a cylindrical section and an open end. Across the whole diameter of this open-end, there is a metal bracket from edge to edge, with a metal rod fixed into the centre of the cone, pointing directly up to the open hole at the narrow end.

Mounted on the exterior of the cylindrical section of the cone are two brass electrical posts with ridged screw ends. Both of these are fitted into a single piece of bakelite, but their ends poke through into the interior of the cone. To each of these, coiled wires insulated in the green fabric are connected. One of these wires is connected to one side of the metal cross-bracket.

Affixed to the outside of the cone is a metal rod with a narrower screw end. On the interior of the cone, this is visible as two small round brass ends.

They had to absorb the laser light reflected from the sample chamber while the laser was operating up to 10-15 watts, and over time the thermal stresses eventually caused the cracking.

""Hydrometers are the fundamental tool for measuring the alcohol potential of freshly crushed grape must, as well as the progress of a fermentation (the process whereby sugars are converted to alcohol via yeast). Made of glass, the bulb is weighted to allow it to float upright when suspended in liquid. A hydrometer will float to a different height on the measuring stick due to differences in the density of the liquid being measured. Because sugar increases the density of water, it is possible to know how much sugar is present when the density changes, i.e., when sugars turn into alcohol, during fermentation. Grape juice at harvest contains about 25% sugar, with lesser amounts in cool climate grapes. Winemakers take frequent readings of the must (fermenting liquid) during fermentation. When the density stops changing and it is near zero, the fermentation is finished"" (The National Museum of American History.)

"Fisher Atom Model Kit","A shallow wooden box with a hinged lid that opens with two clasps on the front, The wood is a medium brown, with a veneer on the masonite top, and the underside of the bottom is bare masonite.

The interior of the box is laid out in a 4 by 5 grid, with separators made of masonite. The inside of the lid has a paper label that is the size of the lid, which has a large diagram that details the type and location of the different model parts. The kit contains models for eight elements. Some of the elements come in different shapes, to allow for the formation of multiple bonds. There are several molecular models currently constructed in the box.

The element models are made of plastic and can be connected by the included bronze connectors. There are 9 sulfur, coloured yellow; 21 oxygen, light blue; 37 nitrogen, dark blue; 34 hydrogen, orange; 7 chlorine, green; 6 bromine, tan; 2 iodine, brown; 65 carbon, black; one miscellaneous grey. There are bronze snap-on connectors to attach the model pieces; there are 42 loose connectors and many more currently used in molecular models. There is also a bronze tool that is shaped like a flat wrench, and that seems to be a separator for prying the pieces apart.

It is noted that some of the pieces, including the miscellaneous grey, appear to come from a different, but related, set, as they are made of painted wood.

There is a circular scale on the metal plate around the edge of the disk; this is labelled in ""True Alt."" ""Miles"" and ""True A.S."". On the interior of the disk, there are two arc-shaped holes each with short scales drawn on the disk above or below the arc. These permit conversion from ""Air Temp. Centigrade"" to ""Ind.

On one edge of this rotating disk, there is an arc-shaped section with a scale along the bottom edge, graduated in units from 0 in the centre to 40 on each side. One side of this is labelled ""Drift Port Var. East"" and the other ""Var. West Drift Strbd"". In the centre of this arc, pointing towards the rotating circle there is an indicator arrow labelled ""True Course"".

Attached to one side of the box there is a hollow cylindrical tube. On the underside of the flat top, there are two plastic rods for holding something flat. Tucked into these rods there is a brown card tag, with a reinforced hole punched at one end. The tag is two-sided and has spaces for information about the instrument and, on the other side, its calibration. The information side has been filled out by hand.

"Dalton Dead Reckoning Computer Model G","This is a metal instrument shaped like a rectangular box. On the top, it has a flat metal plate that is affixed to the box below by a hinge along one edge. When flapped down, this plate sits horizontally over the top of the box. On the plate, there is a circular metal disk with a non-linear scale around the rim, labelled in ""Minutes"" and ""Km Minutes"". There is a circular scale on the metal plate around the edge of the disk; this is labelled in ""True Alt."" ""Miles"" and ""True A.S."". On the interior of the disk, there are two arc-shaped holes each with short scales drawn on the disk above or below the arc. These permit conversion from ""Air Temp. Centigrade"" to ""Ind. Height Thousand Feet"" and the reverse. On the disk there are two short pins; these enable the disk to be rotated in order to do conversions.

This plate flaps up to reveal the rectangular box-shaped instrument underneath. It consists of a top metal plate with a circular hole in it. This is covered by a plastic window. Visible through the window there is a red grid pattern printed on a paper or fabric sheet. This can be moved up and down along its x-axis by turning a ridged knob on one side of the box. Around the edge of the window on a silver-coloured circular rim there is a scale graduated in degrees, and with cardinal directions indicated. This rim can be rotated by turning a ridged metal handle on one side of the box. 

On one edge of this rotating disk, there is an arc-shaped section with a scale along the bottom edge, graduated in units from 0 in the centre to 40 on each side. One side of this is labelled ""Drift Port Var. East"" and the other ""Var. West Drift Strbd"". In the centre of this arc, pointing towards the rotating circle there is an indicator arrow labelled ""True Course"".

Attached to one side of the box there is a hollow cylindrical tube with a loop of cotton string tied onto it. On the underside of the flat top, there are two plastic rods for holding something flat.

On the rear, there are four round holes in the backplate. Through them, the internal rolling grid is visible.

"Dalton Dead Reckoning Computer Model G","This is a metal instrument shaped like a rectangular box. On the top, it has a flat metal plate that is affixed to the box below by a hinge along one edge. When flapped down, this plate sits horizontally over the top of the box. On the plate, there is a circular metal disk with a non-linear scale around the rim, labelled in ""Minutes"" and ""Km Minutes"". There is a circular scale on the metal plate around the edge of the disk; this is labelled in ""True Alt."" ""Miles"" and ""True A.S."". On the interior of the disk, there are two arc-shaped holes each with short scales drawn on the disk above or below the arc. These scales permit conversion from ""Air Temp. Centigrade"" to ""Ind. Height Thousand Feet"" and the reverse.

This plate flaps up to reveal the rectangular box-shaped instrument underneath. It consists of a top metal plate with a circular hole in it. This is covered by a plastic window. Visible through the window there is a red grid pattern printed on a paper or fabric sheet. This can be moved up and down along its x-axis by turning a ridged knob on one side of the box. Around the edge of the window on a silver-coloured circular rim there is a scale graduated in degrees, and with cardinal directions indicated. This rim can be rotated by turning a ridged metal handle on one side of the box. 

On one edge of this rotating disk, there is an arc-shaped section with a scale along the bottom edge, graduated in units from 0 in the centre to 40 on each side. One side of this is labelled ""Drift Port Var. East"" and the other ""Var. West Drift Strbd"". In the centre of this arc, pointing towards the rotating circle there is an indicator arrow labelled ""True Course"".

Attached to one side of the box there is a hollow cylindrical tube. On the underside of the flat top, there are two plastic rods for holding something flat.

Lying loose between the top plate and the rotating circle, although attached to the instrument by a loop of cotton string, there is a brown card tag, with a reinforced hole punched at one end. The tag is two-sided and has spaces for information about the instrument and, on the other side, its calibration. The information side has been filled out by hand.

On the rear, there are four round holes in the backplate. Through them, the internal rolling grid is visible.

"Light Source","2019.ph.831.1: This object consists of a cylindrical tube, mounted horizontally on a metal platform, painted green, that rides on a single triangular-shaped rail. The rail ends in two metal circular sections that fit over the triangle. Rising out of this are posts that support the cylinder at either end. The green platform rides on the 'rail' with two supports that have a screw bolt that enables the supports to be fixed in place. The platform itself is roughly square and has two identical green sections fixed to it. These each have a pair of conical plastic pieces fitted beside each other; this creates a 'v'-shaped support for the cylinder. Also on the platform are two metal brackets that end in adjustable connectors that are affixed to metal flaps that go over the cylinder to hold it in place. 

At one end of the cylinder, there is a small cylindrical metal attachment with a small hole in one end. This sits right up against another cylindrical component, mounted vertically, with a rectangular hole on one side and a round window on the other. Visible through the window there is a small prism. Topping this section is a clear acrylic disk with masking tape on the top. Next to this, there is another vertical cylinder with a wires emerging from it; this has been sealed by a quantity of yellow paste. Also emerging from this end of the cylinder there is a ceramic pot with a screw in it. At the other end of the cylinder there is another cylindrical component that ends in a deep red glass window. Laid over this there is a chain that is looped around the cylinder.

The cylinder itself is silver, with bits of electrical tape affixed.  Laid on top of it there is a length of tube with a thick wire running through it, a length of twisted wires connect to a component, and a metal box attached to a blue wire also connecting to the object. Also coming out of the metal box is a thicker electrical cable that ends in a small male plug.

With the main object, there is a small cardboard box containing a number of components (2019.ph.831.2). This includes two metal rings, with screw holes around the rim, one larger than the other, another disc shape with three fins and a piece of dark glass, broken through the middle, with a paper rim. There is also three larger screws and three smaller screws.

It was established in London in 1847 by Ludwig Oertling (1818-1893), a German scientific instrument maker. Oertling created instruments for commercial and industry use in Great Britain and abroad, with clients such as the Royal College of Chemistry, Trinity College in Dublin, Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and mints and assay offices in Ottawa, San Francisco, Melbourne and Madras. Oertling himself designed a new balance with Dmitri Mendeleev. John Henry Poynting determined the mean density of the Earth using an Oertling balance. Oertling’s chemical, assay and bullion balances are renowned for their level of precision.

The earliest known Oertling balance was the Beale balance, made in 1847. From 1850-1869, the company became Ladd &amp;amp; Oertling as Oertling worked in partnership with Edward Wilds Ladd with whom he expanded the business into producing hydrometers. By 1874, Ladd had retired and Oertling changed the company again to L. Oertling and then L. Oertling Limited in 1914 as he entered into partnership with his sons. Oertling also created the ‘improved assay balance’ in collaboration with George H. Makins, assayer to the Bank of England. Ludwig’s son Henry took over at his father’s death in 1893 until his own death in 1921. In 1925, the company was sold to the W &amp;amp; T Avery Group. After the 1950s, it was renamed Oertling Limited [Buchanan 2013; Morris 2017; ""Science Museum Group Collection"" 2019].",,,,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/?post_type=wpm_instrument&p=13600,draft

"Modified Microscope","This is part of a microscope with a significantly modified stage sitting on a rectangular base. Also attached to the base is a curved rod supporting a lens and a metal box with a hole cut in it.

The microscope is affixed to a rounded rectangular plate base, with two plates on top of one another, the top one being slightly shorter than the bottom. It has a matte black frame with two feet, a central brass hinge, and a curved top, supporting a vertical brass tube with large adjustment knobs on either side. The tube is empty of an eyepiece lens and tube but has a single objective lens fixed to the base.

Directly below the object, the stage is heavily modified. Below the objective lens, there is a piece of glass mounted in a metal frame supported at a diagonal. Beneath this, there is a metal plate with a hole cut in it. Below this, there are two glass microscope slides, one of which is mirrored or partially mirrored. Below this, there is a small gap, another plate and the original stage of the microscope. The position of this entire platform can be adjusted using knobs affixed to the stage.

Hanging below the stage there is a cylindrical component with a knob at the base. Emerging from the side of this there are three strips of metal that connect to an apparatus in the centre of the cylinder. Manipulating these moves three small pegs that pass upwards through the stage and the lower metal plate to sit directly below the glass microscope slides. The three pegs are lined up in a row.

Also connected to the instrument base there is a heavy metal rod that rises vertically and then turns horizontally to support two components. The first is a lens in a cylindrical case, with an aperture adjusting the shutter. This adjusted a rod emerging from the side of the casing. This is supported at a level in line with the diagonal glass section on top of the stage. At the end of the rod, there is a metal box, open on the outside side with an elongated circular hole cut in the centre. This hole is at the same level as the lens and the diagonal glass piece.

"Modified Microscope","This is a part microscope with a modified stage. The instrument stands on the original two feet of the microscope; also retained is the stand of the microscope which is hinged at the stage level. Beneath the curve of the microscope, there is a cylindrical section that reaches to the ground; this may be an additional support for the instrument.

The eyepiece tube and lenses have been replaced with a metal tube that is open at the top and has a small single lens at the objective end. On either side of this tube, there are two large knurled knobs for raising and lowering the modified tube. Two additional cylindrical knobs with knurling over their curved surfaces are just below this; these appear to have no effect on the current microscope arrangement.

The stage is circular and has been modified with additional components. Directly below the objective lens, there is a small, partly-mirrored circular lens in a metal frame affixed to small brackets that hold it at a diagonal. Beneath this, there is a 5mm thick metal plate with a small hole drilled in the centre directly under the lens. Beneath this, there is a second plate, with a gap between the lower and upper. There is a small hole in the lower plate directly below the one in the upper. These two plates run on a rail and can be adjusted on in one dimension by during a knurled knob.

Below this, there is the stage. Suspended beneath the stage is an apparatus consisting of a machined metal disk suspended horizontally. Beneath this, there are some knurled knobs. Two of these knobs can be turned to press against then metal plates set at right angles to one another. Resting on the top of these, at the centre, is a vertical metal rod that runs through the components and up to the stage level. This is all supported by a bracket support system.

"Thin Film Measuring Interference Microscope","2019.ph.846.1: This is a vertical microscope sitting on a rail silver machined rail, which also sits a circular adjustable rotating platform.

The microscope consists of a vertical eyepiece and objective tube supported by a vertical metal support stand and a horizontal arm. Near the top of this, emerging horizontally, there is a short section of the tube, open at the end. Near the base of this, and emerging horizontally, there is a tube with a broader black section at one end, and a base hanging beneath; this contains a light bulb. Emerging from the base of the bulb is a cable that is currently coiled around the instrument for storage. The wire is insulated in grey plastic and splits at the end into two prongs. The whole microscope section can be slid forwards and backwards along a short length of metal rail. A screw with a knurled knob end at the base of the microscope allows it to be fixed in place.

Also seated on the rail is a round platform with a brass top supported by a blocky base with a variety of adjustments. The platform has a metal apparatus on one side with several knobs and screws that enable the fine adjustment of the position of a plastic piece with a notch cut into it that floats just above the platform surface. Three knurled knobs are attached to the blocky section supporting the platform; their purpose is unknown.

A paper label is attached to the base of the microscope stand. Many of the components are coated in a mottled grey-green or grey paint surface.

2019.ph.846.2: Collected with and apparently associated with the microscope is a transformer. This is box-shaped with curved corners, affixed to a slightly larger metal plate with two small holes cut in it. On top of the box, there is a black ridged knob, a metal toggle switch and a small black peg labelled ""FUSE"". A wire emerges from one side and ends in a three-pronged plug with the black plate removed. On the same side, there is a two-pronged socket. This likely fits the two prongs at the end of the lamp wire attached to the microscope. There is a paper label attached to the wire.

"Gardner Season Apparatus","This is an Earth, Sun & Moon system model contained within a large wooden box. The box is roughly square in size, with a small metal handle on one side and two metal latches on two different sides of the box. The lid, once unlatched, lifts off entirely. When stored, the instrument is disassembled. Most of the pieces are held in place inside the box by wooden supports with rotating latches to hold them in places; others are loose. In both the lid and base there are short lengths of string attached by nails at either end to the wood of the box.

The base of the orrery is fixed in place inside the top of the box. It consists of a circular wooden disc formed of a number of layers. Running parallel the circumference of this there are a pair of slots, one deeper and wider than the other. On top of the disk, there is a circular paper printed image affixed to the centre. This contains astronomical information. In the centre of the disk, standing vertically, there is a metal rod. This can be laid flat to store the disk in the box.

In the box, there is a wooden frame formed of several rectangular rods of wood that are attached to the frame that can collapse. At one of this, there is a piece of wood with a hole in the middle of it; this fits over the central rod in the base. Fitted on top of the wooden frame there is a frame formed of rigid wires with curved metal sections attached that sit into lots in metal wires that rise up from the exterior end of the wooden frame. This frame holds up a 5"" diameter model of the Earth with a vertical metal rod through the centre. The rod is slotted into loops on the wooden frame and allows the Earth model to be rotated.

When erected, a metal piece fits into the lower slot around the disk rim, allowing it to slide and supporting the frame so that the Earth model can rotate relatively freely in a circle around the centre rod. Also to be attached to this frame there is a frame formed of two metal strips affixed parallel to one another to a metal frame with hooks on the top; these strips are cut at the ends with curves that match the curves of the sun and moon models.

In the box, there is a gold-painted sphere on a brass cylindrical section with a hole in the centre. This sits on the central rod and acts as a model of the sun.

Also in the box, there is a 5"" diameter sphere, painted matte black, with a rod through the centre (to replace the Earth model); an additional rigid metal frame section formed of a circular section and a rectangular section; two identical semi-circular wireframes painted red; an L-shaped rod with a small blue ball at one end (possibly representing the moon), and a short length of string.

"Constant Deviation Wavelength Spectrometer","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a large metal direct-vision spectrometer. It consists of two tubes fixed at right angles to one another, supported above metal plates that are supported by three legs with slightly tapered bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both tubes are of a similar length. One, the collimator, has a narrower section at the end which can be unscrewed from the larger tube. This section supports at the end a slit formed of two plates of metal fixed over the end of the tube. This slit's width can be adjusted by turning a ridged knob attached to one side. This knob is affixed to a disk with graduations around the outside, labelled in tens. Next to this there is a small metal wedge acting as an indicator arrow. Affixed by a central pin over the top of the slit plates there is a metal disk with two rectangular holes cut in it, one smaller than the other. Over the top of this and attached to the same pin (although rotating independently), there is a metal arm with on one side a rounded section with a white rectangle image engraved on it, and on the other an arm which is raised slightly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where the two tubes meet there is a cylindrical cover with a flat lid; this is engraved with the instrument and maker's name. This is screwed onto the support base, and likely covers a prism. The second tube, the eyepiece, is lined up against this cylinder at right angles to the collimator. It is supported by metal rings, the top half of which can be unscrewed to remove or replace the tubes. Torwards the end of the tube, there is a rod affixed to the exterior of the tube attached to a large ridged knob. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The end of the tube consists of narrower sections fitted inside on another. The first of these sections, fitted into the main tube, has a scale engraved on it, graduated in tens; ""10"" and ""20"" are visible. Next to this is another affixed rod with a knob. The smallest section is an eyepiece with a very small round hole in the centre, with a lens affixed to the inside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Attached to the support for this tube there is a large wheel with a pair of scales engraved around the rim. One of these scales is linear, and labelled in tens from 0 to 980; the other scale is non linear and labelled in hundreds from 4200 to 7700, with the graduations of the higher numberes being smaller. This is attached to and rotated by a ridged knob affixed to a large rod which is parallel to the eyepiece tube. Also affixed by an adjustable arm to the support section is a magnifying glass that can be used to view the the scale on the wheel. The wheel is attached to a very large worm gear that fits against a rack-type gear section, affixed to the base that is underneath the prism cover, permitting fine adjustment of the prism's angle.</p>

"Celestial Globe","This is a medium-sized celestial globe standing on a round metal base. The base is brown and simply decorated by circular ridges. A central pillar rises from this base, supporting a metal semi-circular ring that in turn supports a ring that runs vertically around the full circle of the globe, connected to it at the top and bottom (the meridian). This is broader on the outside, and marked with a scale graduated in degrees on the interior of both sides of the ring. At the top of the ring, this is labelled ""Co-LATITUDE"". This ring can be rotated in the the semi-circular support, enabling the globe's inclination to be altered. 

Around the equator of the globe there is a broad wooden ring with a paper scale stuck to its upper surface. This shows several concentric scales. The outer most is divided into large equal segments, labelled with months. Inside this is a ring dividing these months into days of the year, labelled in 5s up to the final day of the year (28, 30, or 31). Inside this, a scale divided into degrees of a quarter circle and marked in tens from 0 to 90. Inside this, a ring divided into segment labelled with the names of zodiac constellations. Inside this, a ring divided into 24 segments and labelled with hours (0 to 24) and AM and PM. Inside this, scale dividing the 24 sections into six segments, indicating minutes.

The globe itself is cream and brown coloured, and formed of segments of paper that are narrower at the top of the bottom so they fit together to form a spherical picture (gores). These are covered by a shiny varnish. The globe depicts celestial objects such as important stars and galacies. These are named. Constellations are outlined with red lines, and named in both Latin and English. Areas of the sky around these are indicated by dotted lines, and the milky way is shown by a darker area formed by red-brown dots. An equator and ecliptic are marked. Some origins for meteor shows are marked, with associated dates.

At the top of the the globe there is a circular metal piece curved to fit the globe's surface, a portion of which is inset from the rest. This is graduated into 24 portions and marked with the numbers 1 through 12 twice. One side is marked ""A.M."" the other ""P.M.""

"Butterfield-type Pocket Sundial","This is a small sundial. It consists of an elongated octagonal face with circular compass set towards one end of the base. The compass is covered with a glass cover, has a freely rotating central needle and cardinal directions engraved in Latin denomination on the base, alongside a fleur-de-lis.

Standing vertically on the face of the instrument is an triangular metal piece, the gnomon. This is hinged at the base so it can be laid flat. On one side there is engraved a small arced scale labelled from 40 to 60, and on the other a floral pattern. On both sides there is a small metal piece in the shape of a bird, where the bird's beak is operating as a pointer on the scale.

Engraved on the surface of the octagonal face are a set of concentric scales, two of which are labelled with Roman numerals, indicating hours of the day. Between these there is a scale labelled in Arabic numbers, from 4 to 12 (at the gnomon) and then 1 to 7; these roughly align with the Roman numerals. Small numbers engraved at the ends of each of these, ""40"" ""43"" ""45"" ""49"", indicate differing latitudes.

On the rear of the instrument, there is a small rod with a rounded ended that enables the instrument to sit on a flat surface. Near to this there is a small flat of metal with a screw through it. Engraved on the rear of the face and the compass base there are the names of a number of European cities and their respective latitudes.

"Solar Chronometer","This is an semi-circular instrument sitting on a wooden base, with a wooden cover. The cover has a metal handle on the lid, and a pair of metal hooks on either end. The base is rectangular, with metal loops on either of the narrower ends. 

The instrument sits on top of the base can consists of a semi-circular metal frame, oriented vertically, with a space between the two outer edges, creating an internal curved surface facing upwards. Into this there is a rectangular piece of cardboard printed with a warped, curved grid pattern, fitted into the base of the cuve. This is labelled ""Standard Time"" at the lowest point. Across one long edge of this grid there are Roman numerals from VII to XI, and I to V, with ""NORTH"" in the middle at the lowest point. On the other side, the Roman numerals appear in the opposite order, with ""SOUTH"" at the lowest point. On the short ends the months from ""July"" to ""Dec."" are indicated along the wavy line of the edge of the grid edge.

Half way through this, dividing the semi-circular shape into quarter-circles at the lowest point, there are two horizontal rods that cross the grid space at the top. Thes enarrow to points where they meet, creating a precise point. Suspended below one of these there is a rod with a pointed base that is hinged so it can rotate 90 degrees along a curved bracket fitted into the base of the curve. An unlabeled scale is engraved along the base of this curved bracket.

Outside of the semi-circular frame, there is a metal bracket that is fixed to the centre of the frame by two screws. This connects to a metal ball that is fitted behind a metal plate. Next to this there is a screw knob. Loosening the knob permits the angle of the semi-circular frame to be adjusted and fixed into place, with the metal ball operating as a freely rotating ball and socket hinge. On either side of the semi-circular frame, wooden brackets are affixed to the base to guide the instrument into its 'resting' position on the wooden base.

This supports a half-circle metal arc under the bottom hemisphere of the globe that holds up a broad metal ring that runs horizontally around the circumference of the globe (the horizon band) on a flat plane, and a narrower metal ring fitted inside the horizon band that passes through the poles of the globe (the meridian). Both of these are marked with a metal scale, graduated in degrees. The flat horizon band is marked in 360 degrees and ""North"", ""South"", ""East"" and ""West"", the meridian in four quarters of 90 degrees.

The globe is covered by strips of paper that meet at the poles to cover the whole globe. This is covered with a shiny substance. The surface is yellow, and printed in blank ink with lines depicting the celestial equator, ecliptic and galactic circle, as well as celestial features depicting stars. Some constellations and stars are named.

"Terrestrial Globe","This is heavy a terrestrial globe on a stand that enables it to wobble and tilt in all directions on its axis. The stand is metal, with a simple round base, painted black and a vertical rod rising from the centre. This supports the globe and a semi-circular bracket that curves around and supports a broad ring around the circumference of the globe at the equator (the horizon band). This is divided into broad sections, but not graduated or marked with a scale.

The globe is a standard hemisphere on its top half; however, the bottom is cut off towards the base (eliminating the tip of South America and half of New Zealand), and open. This allows the supporting rod to enter the base of the globe and support it at the rough centre of the globe, and enables the globe to be tilted in all directions. When tilted, the globe swings back to a vertical position. 

Rising from the centre of the top of the globe there is a metal rod with a series of ridged rings at the top end, which then narrows to a point. Affixed to the horizon band and rising first vertically and then in an arc is a metal rod that ends in a brass-coloured point that points directly down at the point rising from the globe. 

The surface of the globe is formed out of strips of paper which narrow to a point towards the poles of the globe (gores) affixed to a cardboard surface. Around the equator there is a thick metal ring that aligns with the horizon band. The globe depicts the Earth, with countries outlined in colour and water shown in blue. Continents, regions, countries, oceans, major cities, rivers and railway lines are shown and/or labelled. Latitude and longitude lines are shown, as is the ecliptic; this is graduated in small sections, and labelled with ""10"", ""20"" and ""30"" which repeat around the circumference of the globe.

"Gestetner Mimeograph Stencils","This is flat rectangular cardboard box containing a number of copies of U of T physics exams. The box is printed on the top in orange, green and cream. There is a table stuck to the edge of the box at one end. 

Inside the box there are 24 Gestetner brand stencil sheets. Each consists of two sheets, one on top of one another, and fixed together at the top by a stiffer cardboard section punched with four large holes and a number of smaller ones in a particular pattern. The top sheet is thin like tissue paper, but waxy. Around the rim of the sheet there is red printing with scales along all four sides and ""WHITE STENCIL No. 62"" printed at the top. The scales at the top and bottom are divided into two sets of graduations, one on the top, with five graduations per label, apparently labelled ""Pica"" and one at the bottom, with six, and labelled ""Elite"". On the left and right of the sheet the scales are labelled 1 to 75 down each side. Across each piece of paper there are red lines: a dotted line down the centre and solid lines across the lower portion of the sheet. These delineate paper sheet sizes.

Printed in the centre of each sheet there is lettering. The lettering is formed by punched letters outlined in black ink. In places, on some of the exams, there are bright pink marks, apparently indicating corrections. Each document is a University of Toronto Annual Examinations on a physics topic, such as ""Electricity"" or ""Least Squares"". Dates range between 1894 and 1896. 

A document written by Don Moorcroft was found with the box. This speculates on the history of the exams, and enumerates the exams in the box.

"Resistance Pyrometer","This is an instrument contained inside a wooden box. The box is varnished and rectangular with four round rubber feet on one large face and four rubber feet on a narrower edge, so it can be stood in two orientations. When placed ""upright"" according to labelling, neither set of rubber feet is on the base.

On the top of the box, there are two electrical posts with black plastic covers; one of these has a small round piece marked with a ""+"" next to it. On the base of the instrument, there is a small metal label with a screw end in the centre. This is labelled ""ZERO CORRECT"". On one side of the box, there are two metal loops fixed to the box by metal brackets.

The front of the box is hinged horizontally across the centre and latched with a sliding knob at the top. The top half of the box flaps open to reveal an arc-shaped glass window set in a black plastic surround. Behind the window is an arc-shaped scale graduated in 2s and labelled in 20s from 0 to 300. Below this, there is an arc-shaped mirror. The scale is labelled ""°C"".

On the interior of the opened flap, which folds down over the bottom half of the box there is a metal label with Japanese writing on it and a diagram of the instrument connected to another instrument by a circuit.

There is a cardboard tag, partially in Japanese, attached to the box by a short length of cotton string.

Some constellations are outlined, former the structure of the constellation, and labelled in Latin. Some major stars are labelled. The celestial equator and ecliptic--which is labelled with zodiac constellations--are also shown as a thick, segmented line. The globe is covered with a regular grid; shown as slightly thicker lines are the equinoctial and solstitial colures.

At the top of the the globe there is a circular metal piece, a portion of which is inset from the rest. This is graduated into 24 portions and marked with the numbers 1 through 12 twice. One side is marked ""A.M."" the other ""P.M.""

"Oticon Hearing Aid","This object consists of a small grey control unit, an earpiece and attached wire, and a small instructional booklet contained in a small brown case with zip closure. The case is brown plastic, with a faux-leather pattern and matching brown zip and brass-coloured zipper pull. The interior is lined in faux suede material, also brown, and has grey attached elastic sections for keeping components in place. 

The control unit is a small box roughly rectangular in shape but tapered at one end and covered in grey plastic casing, with curved corners. It has a metal clip attached to one side for attaching to clothing. The bottom of the box is darker in colour and can be removed to reveal a place for a short battery. On one side of the box, there is a small female socket with two pins; this matches the plug on the earpiece wire. On a larger face, there is a small round hole with an arrow arced around it and the letter ""A"" written nearby.

On the top of the box, fitted into a darker plastic surround are a number of dials and switches, all of which are light grey in colour. Two rocking switches allow switching between positions marked for one switch ""M"", ""MT"" and ""T"" and for the other ""H"" ""N"" ""L"". There another rocking switch that can switch between ""+"" and ""0"". There is a dial mounted so one edge protrudes with a ridged edge that is numbered from 1 to 9 in evenly spaced intervals. Situated between these four adjustments there is a recessed area covered with a fine mesh. 

Also in the box, there is a section of coiled wire with a very small male plug at one end with two silver pins. The wire consists of two beige-coloured wires coiled around each other. It ends in a roughly cylindrical earpiece piece consisting of a beige plastic backing, a metal cylinder with a raised section in the middle with a small round hole in the middle. Around this, flush against the broader ring, there is a green washer.

Also in the case, there is a small booklet with an orange cover. This booklet contains basic information about getting used to using a hearing aid.

"Celestial Globe","This is a large, blue celestial globe standing on a circular base. The base is made of grey plastic, with a metal ring around the circumference of the round base. Rising from the centre of the base is central pillar that supports a semi-circular ring on the bottom half of the globe: this is broad and rounded on the outside edge.

Fitted into the inner edge of this is a metal ring (the meridian) that runs around the full circumference of the globe on the vertical. The interior meridian ring can be slid inside the semi-circular support ring so the globe can be fully rotated on this axis. The ring is broader on the exterior edge, and  on the marked with a raised scale on both sides of the interior edge, graduated in degrees and labelled in tens. The top of the ring is labelled ""COLATITUDE"". 

Running around the equator of the globe is there is a broad wooden horizontal ring (the horizon band). This has a multi-coloured paper label stuck to its upper surface and divided into various concentric rings. The outermost ring is divided into even segments labelled with the months. Inside this there are rounded rectangles of even size labelled with the names of the zodiac constellations and images showing associated animals or symbols. Inside this there is a narrower ring labelled with the cardinal directions. Inside this, there are a pair of narrower rings segmented in tens of degrees. Of these two, the outer ring is labelled ""AZIMUTH FROM NORTH POINT"", the inner ""AZIMUTH"". 

The globe is connected to the metal meridian ring at the north and south poles and can be rotated at these connection points. The globe's background is a mid-blue over the entirety of its surface. The globe is covered with a black grid pattern printed in black ink. Stars and other celestial objects are depicted as dots or star shapes depending on their brightness; particularly bright objects are shown with a white circle around the exterior of the star shape. Some contellations are outlined with dotted lines, and areas of the sky are outlined in solid dark blue lines and labelled in blue writing. The equator, eclipic, and solstial and equinoctial colures are marked as broader black lines. 

At the top of the the globe there is a circular metal piece curved to fit the globe's surface and resting on it, a portion of which is inset from the rest. This is graduated into 24 portions and marked with the numbers 1 through 12 twice. One side is marked ""A.M."" the other ""P.M.""

"Celestial Globe","This is a medium-sized celestial globe standing on a round metal base. The base is brown and simply decorated by circular ridges. A central pillar rises from this base, supporting a metal semi-circular ring that in turn supports a ring that runs vertically around the full circle of the globe, connected to it at the top and bottom (the meridian). This is broader on the outside, and marked with a scale graduated in degrees on the interior of both sides of the ring. At the top of the ring, this is labelled ""Co-LATITUDE"". This ring can be rotated in the the semi-circular support, enabling the globe's inclination to be altered. 

Around the equator of the globe there is a broad wooden ring with a paper scale stuck to its upper surface. This shows several concentric scales. The outer most is divided into large equal segments, labelled with months. Inside this is a ring dividing these months into days of the year, labelled in 5s up to the final day of the year (28, 30, or 31). Inside this, a scale divided into degrees of a quarter circle and marked in tens from 0 to 90. Inside this, a ring divided into segment labelled with the names of zodiac constellations. Inside this, a ring divided into 24 segments and labelled with hours (0 to 24) and AM and PM. Inside this, scale dividing the 24 sections into six segments, indicating minutes.

The globe itself is cream and brown coloured, and formed of segments of paper that are narrower at the top of the bottom so they fit together to form a spherical picture (gores). These are covered by a shiny varnish. The globe depicts celestial objects such as important stars and galacies. These are named. Constellations are outlined with red lines, and named in both Latin and English. Areas of the sky around these are indicated by dotted lines, and the milky way is shown by a darker area formed by red-brown dots. An equator and ecliptic are marked. Some origins for meteor shows are marked, with associated dates.

At the top of the the globe there is a circular metal piece curved to fit the globe's surface, a portion of which is inset from the rest. This is graduated into 24 portions and marked with the numbers 1 through 12 twice. One side is marked ""A.M."" the other ""P.M.""

Globe,"This is a plain black globe with a metal horizon band, on an ornamental metal stand. The stand has three feet modeled to look like paws, with a tapering central pillar molded with foliage patterns and lines. This pillar is connected to a short arm which supports the globe at its south pole at a slight incline. At the north pole, there is a metal knob. 

Mounted horizontally around the circumference of the broadest part of the globe there is a broad metal ring (a horizon band). This is unmarked. It is supported by three long metal rods rising from the top of each of the three feet of the stand. 

The globe is painted a uniform black, with a deep red grid over its surface depicting some longitude and latitude lines, including the equator. The ecliptic is also shown.

"Earth, Moon and Sun Tellurium","This is a mechanical demonstration model depicting the Earth, Moon & Sun system. The model stands on a heavy metal stand with a circular base. Around the rim of the base, the metal base is surrounded by a dodecagonal piece of wood with a paper scale affixed to its upper surface. On the outer edge, this is divided into twelve sections which show the names and images related to the twelve zodiac signs, with stars shown in the background. Inside these there are series of circular scales shown as concentric circles. The two rings directly inside the zodiac rings show the months and the days of the months. Inside this there is a ring showing the cardinal directions. Inside this, a scale graduated in degrees and labelled in four sections of 90 degrees. 

Connected to the top of the centre of the metal base there is a metal arm with a decorative upper side. This rotates. Rising directly out of the centre of this, above the stand there is a rod which supports a gold-coloured metal piece cut with a jagged edge cut in a slightly curve on one side (this represents the sun). In the middle of this there is a horizontally oriented cylindrical piece with a hole through its centre. This rotates with the arm so the hole is always pointing outwards, to the model of the Earth.

The metal arm is about 30cm long. At the far end it broadens into a circular section. This supports a terrestrial globe, oriented vertically, that rotates on its axis. Supported by a metal arm over the top of the globe is a section formed of two rods curved to fit around the globe and running parallel to one another around three-quarters of the circumference of the globe. This can be tilted a few degrees, although is prevented from doing further by a metal pin. Connected to the north pole pin of the globe there is a arm that is curved over the surface of the globe from the north pole to just beyond the equator. This is engraved with a scale marked in tens from 0 to 80, beginning at the equator and ending near the north pole. Beneath the globe there is a small handle with a knob that enables the globe to be turned independently of the other apparatus.

Mounted below the scale on a geared apparatus is a curved metal arm. This supports a smaller ball, painted black on one hemisphere and white on the other, split on a vertical axis; this represents the moon. This is connected to the central rod that supports the earth globe, such that when the arm is rotated, the earth and moon both rotate in a realistic manner on their axes. 

The surface of the terrestrial globe is formed from strips of paper that narrow to points at the top and bottom, fitted together to form a spherical image (gores). These a covered in a shiny surface. The globe is shown in colour, with blue bodies of water and countries shown in yellow, green, pink and orange. Bodies of water, countries, islands, continents and major cities are labelled. Wind directions and systems and water currents are shown with black arrows and red lines. Isothermal lines for June and January are shown as blue and red solid lines. The equator and ecliptic are shown as a black and white graduated line. An analemma is marked in the pacific ocean. Various keys and informational notes are included over the surface of the globe.

"Torica Astro Globe","This is a clear plastic celestial globe with a small terrestrial globe in its centre. The base is circular and made of wood; this has been painted yellow. The globe stands on three metal legs formed out of thick rods which have been fixed to the circular base with screws. These three legs are connected at the centre by a cylindrical plastic section. 

This section supports a circular metal ring on a vertical orientation. Inside this, there is a smaller pale-green plastic ring with a raised scale molded on it (a meridian), that also goes all around the globe; this can slide so the inclination of the celestial globe can be altered. This is graduated in degrees, and labeled a ten-degree intervals in pairs of quarter-circles; one side is marked from 0 to -90 0, the other 0 to ""+90"" to 0 (although there is no marking at the ""90"" position). Between these two full rings there is a semi-circular ring, graduated in regular sections, over the top hemisphere of the globe; this can be rotated independently from the north pole, allowing it to be used over the globe.

Also connected to the outer ring there is a horizontally oriented green plastic ring, molded with a scale, that also goes around the globe (the horizon band). This is also graduated in degrees, and labelled in ten degree intervals from 0 to 360, with ""S"" marked on one side and ""N"" on the other. 

At both the north and south poles of the globe, curved to sit close on the globe's surface, there is affixed a circular grey plastic ring with a raised scale labelled in 24 equal graduations marked on it.

The metal ring and meridian combination supports the outer globe at the south and north poles. The outer globe is formed of two hemispheres of clear plastic, fitted together at the equator. Around the equator there is a band of residue suggesting there was once tape around the circumference. There are rectangles of masking tape stuck on top of this at regular intervals, these are marked with handwritten degree measurements. Molded on the interior surface of the outer globe, there are markings indicating stars and celestial bodies, a dotted area indicating the milky way, and other significant features; major stars of constellations are marked in yellow. Most of these are labelled with Messier numbers (e.g. ""M34""). Major constellations are labelled. Areas of the sky are divided up by dotted lines. The ecliptic is marked by a band and a dotted line. In the lower hemisphere of the celestial globe, there is a round hole through which the interior components can be reached.

At the centre of the celestial globe there is a small terrestrial globe. This is fitted onto to a rod that runs from the north to south pole of the celestial globe and through the north and south poles of the terrestrial globe. When the celestial globe is rotated, the globe remains in place. The globe is covered in paper strips fitted together, on which continents, some countries, oceans and other major features are printed in blues, yellows and greens. 


Around the globe, about 2 and 3cm distant from its surface respectively are a pair of wire rings; the inclinations of these can be altered. These are connected via rigid wires to the base of the celestial globe, allowing these 'orbits' to rotate with the outer globe.

Also inside the outer globe there are two small balls, one yellow and one red, with the red one about 1cm in diameter and the yellow about 0.5cm. Each of these is fixed to the end of one of two curved rigid wires which are connected at the other end to a knob affixed to the celestial globe just next to the globe's north pole.

"Torica Astro Globe","This is a clear plastic celestial globe with a small terrestrial globe in its centre. The base is circular and made of wood; this has been painted yellow. The globe stands on three metal legs formed out of thick rods which have been fixed to the circular base with screws. These three legs are connected at the centre by a cylindrical plastic section. 

This section supports a circular metal ring on a vertical orientation. Inside this, there is a smaller pale-green plastic ring with a raised scale molded on it (a meridian), that also goes all around the globe; this can slide so the inclination of the celestial globe can be altered. This is graduated in degrees, and labeled a ten-degree intervals in pairs of quarter-circles; one side is marked from 0 to -90 0, the other 0 to ""+90"" to 0 (although there is no marking at the ""90"" position). Between these two full rings there is a semi-circular ring, graduated in regular sections, over the top hemisphere of the globe; this can be rotated independently from the north pole, allowing it to be used over the globe.

Also connected to the outer ring there is a horizontally oriented green plastic ring, molded with a scale, that also goes around the globe (the horizon band). This is also graduated in degrees, and labelled in ten degree intervals from 0 to 360, with ""S"" marked on one side and ""N"" on the other. 

At both the north and south poles of the globe, curved to sit close on the globe's surface, there is affixed a circular grey plastic ring with a raised scale labelled in 24 equal graduations marked on it.

The metal ring and meridian combination supports the outer globe at the south and north poles. The outer globe is formed of two hemispheres of clear plastic, fitted together at the equator. Molded on the interior surface of the outer globe, there are markings indicating stars and celestial bodies, a dotted area indicating the milky way, and other significant features; major stars of constellations are marked in yellow. Most of these are labelled with Messier numbers (e.g. ""M34""). Major constellations are labelled. Areas of the sky are divided up by dotted lines. The ecliptic is marked by a band and a dotted line. In the lower hemisphere of the celestial globe, there is a round hole through which the interior components can be reached; this is covered by a circular cover which is held in place by crossing plastic strips. This contains a key for the various symbols on the celestial globe.

At the centre of the celestial globe there is a small terrestrial globe. This is fitted onto to a rod that runs from the north to south pole of the celestial globe and through the north and south poles of the terrestrial globe. When the celestial globe is rotated, the globe remains in place. The globe is covered in paper strips fitted together, on which continents, some countries, oceans and other major features are printed in blues, yellows and greens. 


Around the globe, about 2 and 3cm distant from its surface respectively are a pair of wire rings; the inclinations of these can be altered. These are connected via rigid wires to the base of the celestial globe, allowing these 'orbits' to rotate with the outer globe.

Also inside the outer globe there are two small balls, one yellow and one red, with the red one about 1cm in diameter and the yellow about 0.5cm. Each of these is fixed to the end of one of two curved rigid wires which are connected at the other end to a knob affixed to the celestial globe just next to the globe's north pole.

Globe,"This is a black globe on a wooden four-legged stand. The stand consists of four ornamental varnished wooden legs that support a circular wooden ring that goes around the circumference of the equator of the globe (the horizon band). This band is unmarked. Underneath the globe, the legs are connected by wooden rods that cross directly underneath the globe and support a short vertical metal pillar that in turn holds up the the globe. This also holds a metal ring that runs vertically around the circumference of the globe (the meridian). 

This ring is brass, and plain on one side. On the otherside, it is engraved with scale graduated in degrees and marked in tens of degrees in four quarter circles (from '0' to '90'). The ring sits in metal grooves at the base and on the two sides of the wooden ring around the equator of the globe and can be slide in these grooves so it can be rotated on this access. This ring can be fixed in place by tightening a screw knob underneath the globe. 

At the north pole of the globe there is a small metal ring with three curved spokes. This is slightly domed to match the curve of the globe. Around the rim of this ring there is is a scale divided into 24 equal sections. These are labelled in Roman numerals from 'I' to 'XXII' twice. 

The globe itself is painted black, with dark red lines painted over the top indicating certain lines of longitude, latitude and the equator and ecliptic.

Haemometer,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a small box containing an instrument and a number of other small objects. The box is black, and covered with black leather or faux leather covering with a fine grain. There is a gold transfer label in one corner of the lid of the box, and a rectangular shape indicating a removed sticker or label in the upper left of the lid of the box. The box lid is hinged and has a small latch at the front.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The central component is a small plastic item consisting of a broader base and a rectangular section rising about 8cm out of it. This has on one side a translucent white screen, and on the other three slots for cylindrical items oriented vertically. Two of these slots, on the left and right, are permanently containing translucent orange tubes. The central slot is empty and has a hole directly above it in the plastic casting for inserting a component with a circular profile; in the base of this there is another cylindrical hole for holding the component upright. This component is stored centrally in the box and there is a label stuck under where it lies, and a small piece of red paper at its head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in the box, stored at one end, there is a small plastic cylindrical container which unscrews in the middle. Inside is contained a small glass test tube with a red rubber stopper. There is some residue inside the glass.</p>

"Surgical Instrument","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This surgical instrument has an open, oval handle which ends in a 5 cm long arm with multiple attachments. The right side of the handle forms the top of the arm, and the left side forms the bottom. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the top of the arm, there is a pointed shaft that points back towards the handle and is held down by a screw. The far end of the shaft has a knurled lever shaped like a ""T"". To the left of this, there is a long narrow hook that curves upwards and rightwards. Near the tip of the hook, there is a small notch, covered by a wire. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This wire travels along the top of the hook, and is attached to the bottom arm of the instrument. The mechanism is actuated by squeezing the handle, which pulls the wire away from the tip of the hook, opening up the small notch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is an old label on the underside of the right handle, and there is a double loop of string tied around the handle.</p>

"Collens Sphygmo-Oscillometer","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is an instrument contained inside a black metal box, with a scale visible behind a plastic window. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The box is roughly rectangular, with curved edges and a metal base lined with green felt. Two sides of the box are slanted, so the base of the box is slightly broader than the top. In one corner of the box there is a raised metal section, with a fan shaped opening covered in a clear plastic window. Visible behind this there is a face with two arc-shaped scales marked on it. The topmost of these is labelled ""Blood Pressure mmHg""  and is graduated in 2s and labelled in 20s from 20 to 280. The scale below this is labelled ""Oscillometer"" and is graduated in 0.5 and labelled in units from 1 to 20. Below this there is company information about the instrument.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the top and one of the slanted sides of the instrument there is a panel door. This can be opened by moving to the side a small ridged knob located next to the door. The door opens to reveal a chamber containing purple coloured rolled length of fabric that is narrower at one end than the other (a cuff) and dark brown tube. The fabric, when unrolled, has a label sewn to the end reading: ""This side out"". At this end, the fabric contains a flexible plastic inflatable chamber which is connected to the tube which runs to the instrument. Towards the instrument end of the tube there is a bulbous rubber hand pump section. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also on top of the box there is a round number reading ""OSC"". This can be rotated slightly.</p>

"Aortic Dilator","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This instrument has a large spring handle with a long, curved shank. The working end of the shank has an expandable mechanism that is actuated by the handle. On the working side of the mechanism, the shank narrows to a dull, hollow point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The dilatation mechanism is composed of three bars set at equal intervals around the shank. When the handle is actuated, the working tip is pulled towards the handle and the bars extend away from the shank. Each bar is lifted by three lever arms that keep the bars parallel to the shank.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The handle end of the shank inserts into a cylinder that has a base plate in the shape of a round triangle, with a curved slot along its base. There is a lever that protrudes through the slot, which can be loosened to rotate the plate. The shank continues through these plates and protrudes on the handle side, where it is attached with a screw-mechanism that can be tightened to hold it still.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hinge of the handle is a screw with a groove knob. Below the hinge, there is a screw through the left side of the handle, that can be tightened to prevent the handle from being closed. There is a spring between the two handles, just below the screw.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the middle of the handle, there is a stepped bar that protrudes from the right handle and that fits in a slot in the left shank of the handle. There is a dial that can be turned to prevent the bar from being pushed through the slot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the left shank of handle, there is a deep groove. The end of the right shank curves outwards and has a hole through it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

"Portable Universal Equinoctial Dial","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is an instrument that consists of a brass base and a brass stand on which a semi-circular metal dial plate and gnomon are attached. The base is circular and has a felt bottom. It has a compass set into it with a central needle, engraved cardinal directions and scale around the rim graduated in degrees. Next to this, on the vertical edge of the base, there is a small rod emerging from a slot. Sliding this fixes the compass needle in place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top portion of the instrument consists of two semi-circular pieces. One of these is oriented vertically in order to hold a thin rod (the gnomon) in place, and the other horizontal half-moon piece is oriented more horizontally and is the dial plate set parallel to the Equator. The dial plate and gnomon portion of the instrument is controlled by a knob affixed to the stand of the instrument, which is attached to a broad needle that indicates on an arc shaped scale graduated from 0 to 90. </p>

<p>The dial plate also contains an engraved scale. The number 12 appears in the middle of the intersection of the vertical and horizontal half moons while the left portion of the dial plate contains the numbers 1-8 and the right contains the numbers 11-4. These numbers represent the hours in a day.</p>

The equinoctial dial is used to show Local Apparent Time (L.A.T), which can then be converted to standard time. One drawback of the equinoctial dial is that no clear shadow is created during the spring and autumn equinoxes due to the fact that the sun moves in a circle nearly the same as the equatorial plane.","Excellent: There are some small scratches and corrosion on the metal components of the instrument; there is more corrosion on the rear of the scale and the stand.

<p>This object is kept in a triangularly shaped leather case with a flap-close and a hole in the flap to attach to a pin to allow it to be closed. The object itself consists of a square metal tube with an open end and at the other end a round, ridged screw adjuster. Attached to one side of this tube is a metal semi-circle shape with a scale marked in divisions of tens around the curved edge. At the far ends of the scale, the divisions are twenties and thirties. Attached to the centre of this protractor shape is a piece of metal with a spirit level/bubble in the middle. An extending arm reaches down from the centre of the semi-circle on a pivot slider with an arrow that acts as an indicator on the scale. This can be fixed in place with a ridged screw knob.</p>

June 3, 1898) in 1940. When described by Seely in 1941, and in some other literature, the instrument is called a ""duoscope"".

It can be compared to a number of similar optical instruments for creating maps from aerial photographs such as the rectoplanigraph, the reflecting projector, the multiscope, etc. This technology is described in contemporary literature on photogrammetry, cartography, forestry, and so on.

Using the seelyscope, each eye viewed a different image and the images were superimposed in the brain. Images were aligned with the aid of reticles in the eyepieces. This process was reportedly difficult to control and could cause severe eyestrain. [Spurr, 113].

The instrument was produced for the Dominion Forestry Service of the Department of Mines and Resources (now Natural Resources Canada), where Seely spent his career. There he developed new methods for applying aerial photography to forestry and cartography. (For details see Robinson 1981.)

The instrument was produced by Spartan Air Services of Ottawa, Ontario, a company engaged in aerial surveying that had been founded by RCAF veterans. Parts of the early versions (perhaps later versions as well) were produced at the machine shop of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa.

"Terrestrial Globe","This is a terrestrial globe with colourful countries standing on a wooden stand. The wooden stand consists of a circular disk with a broader base than top supported by four rounded feet affixed to its base. The globe is supported by a semi-circular metal ring that is connected to the centre of this base, and in turn supports a ring that goes around the full circumference of the globe (a meridian) and is connected to it at the north and south poles. These connections allow the globe to be rotated on its axis. 

The meridian ring is metal, with a molded scale graduated in degrees on its interior edge around the entirety of the ring. The graduations are labelled in tens in four quarter-circles from 0 to 90. An additional ring, formed of thick wire is loose around the globe. This appears to have originally been connected to the meridian ring via a pair of metal brackets that slot over the edge of the meridian ring; however, both these brackets are loose from the bracket. 

The surface of the globe is formed by strips of paper tapered to points at the top and bottom, that are fitted together to form the map (gores). These are colourful, with blue water and countries shown in pink, green, yellow and mauve. Oceans, continents, countries, islands, and major cities are labelled. A grid of longitude and latitude lines is marked in blue. The equator is marked as a graduated line. Some blue lines indicate apparent important shipping routes; these are marked with decimal numbers. 

At the north pole, slightly curved so it matches the arc of the sphere, there is a circular metal plate graduated into 24 sections and labelled with the numbers 1-12 repeated twice around its rim, and ""HIGH NOON"" and ""MIDNIGHT"". Half of this is black, the other half silver, with stripy sections indicating dusk and dawn. This can be rotated. 

There is a legend in a cartouche on one side of the globe (in the Pacific Ocean). This gives indications for landscape markings, city size markings and scales.

<p>This item is contained in a grey plastic suitcase-like box, with a plastic handle and two metal latches that can be opened by depressing sprung metal strips that merge from the side of the latches. The hinges of the suitcase are detachable so the lid of the box can be entirely removed. The corners of the suitcase are covered with reinforcing metal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The instrument consists of a control panel built into the bottom of the suitcase. Along the top of the panel are plugs of different designs for tubes with different arrangements and pins of various sizes. In the centre of this, there is a window set in a raised box with a number of scales behind it, and a single indicating needle. Next to this, there are two dials with large metal surrounds and graduations around the rim, a red dome covering a lamp and a small freely rotating knob.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beneath all of these, there is a row of nine identical knobs, black plastic, with a built-in indicating pointer and a white line painted on to indicate the direction of the knobs. Each of these has an identical scale printed on the panel around it. These dials and scales are numbered one through nine and labelled with the word ""Elements"".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beneath this, there are four additional knobs, a red dome for an indicator light with an on/off toggle switch next to it, two large toggle switches and a small depressable button switch on a rod. Beneath this, and visible behind three rectangular windows set into the panel surface are some printed informational scrolls. These can be scrolled up and down to reveal new information by means of a ridged dial on the right-hand side. All three windows have a red line through the centre to identify and compare information across the windows. On the other side of this at the edges of the panel, there are two small metal rods affixed like small handles. Near this, on the right-hand side of the panel emerges a power cable with a standard three-prong plug on the end.</p>

"Newtonian Double-Sided Plate Holder","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This instrument consists of a number of roughly circular metal components on top of one another, all painted back, with a rectangular box at the top. Red and yellow wires are attached. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The base rings form an aperture and connection plate to a large telescope. Visible on the inside there are a pair of flapping shutters hinged on the outside and operated by a knob on the exterior of the instrument; behind this the plate box is visible. Above the attachment plates, there is a section of rungs which form an adjustable section; these pieces are not closely next to one another but instead 'floating' about half a millimeter apart, enabling adjustment. Around the exterior of these 'floating' rings, there are two points of adjustment, one on either side of the instrument, One of these consists of a knurled knob connected to a rod which runs beside the circular section and screws into a plate attached to an adjacent section of the ring. On the other side, there is another knurled knob; this one is attached to a knob with a scale around the circumference, which is attached to a screw rod that points directly towards the circular ring where it presses against a small circular plate. Below this, there is a spring that connects to an adjacent corner of a lower ring via a complicated mechanism which includes a small unmarked scale and an indicator arrow. There is a similar mechanism near the other knob. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last section is the smallest in diameter and fixed to the rear of the instrument. It consists of a cylindrical section with a broader rim which is attached via heavy bolts to the rearmost floating ring. On either side of this, in the back portion, there a pair of rounded openings. One of these has a small tube with a lens in it pointing directly into the opening. This tube's orientation is adjustable via a bracket that connects the instrument to a carriage that runs along a scale with a vernier attachment. The carriage's movement is adjusted by a knurled knob. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the rear of this piece, there is a rectangular box with a green sticker on it, reading ""1"". A similar sticker is nearby. This box can be removed by turning a metal latch, revealing an internal box section where a photographic plate can be placed. On one side of this, there is a knob to adjust the plate holder's position in one dimension. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around the exterior of the instrument, there are wires. These emerge coiled together from the lens tube and then split into two pairs of red and yellow wires, one of which runs to a dial fixed to the rearmost plate. The other cable runs to a two-pronged plug.</p>

"Horn Speaker","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a trumpet-shaped horn standing upright on a black cylinder affixed to a wooden base. The horn is made of metal, conical, and vertical until near the end where it turns at roughly a right angle and flares more sharply. The more flared section is formed of a different metal panel to the rest of the horn.</p>

Typewriter,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a typewriter with an open body and keyboard, meaning the internal workings of the typewriter are largely visible. The body is made of metal and forms a frame around the components of the keyboard; this is painted black with yellow and blue decoration. The keys are circular, with their labels behind the plastic set in metal surrounds. These are arranged in a QWERTY layout, with a black space bar extending the entire length of the base of the keyboard. Affixed above the keyboard to the front of the frame there are two keys, one red and one black affixed to either end of a rocking switch. When one of these keys is depressed, a rod in the interior of the typewriter is moved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above the keyboard are two scales, one white and one red, both in inches. Visible between this and the keyboard are a series of rods with letter stamps affixed to the end (the typebars); these are arranged in a u-shape and lying horizontally. When a key is pressed, these rise to a vertical position to strike a black cylindrical roller (the platen). This roller is mounted at the top of the instrument, above the frame. It can be rolled forwards by turning black knobs on the right and left-hand side of the roller that juts out slightly from the case. This roller fits into the centre of the carriage, which carries the roller to the left when typing. Connected to this there is a pointer that moves with the carriage and points to the scale mounted above the keyboard, indicating position on the page. On the left side of the carriage, there is a latch that when pulled turns the roller a short fixed distance. There are several other knobs, latches, switches, and indicators on the instrument. On the left-hand side there is a bell, mounted horizontally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the back of the carriage, there is a slanted plate with a rolled top. This reads ""Underwood"" in gold lettering. Next to this, there is an image of a typewriter. The typewriter stands on four rubber feet.</p>

"Troughton & Simms Transit Telescope","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This object is contained inside a large wooden box, painted grey, which has a green moving label stuck to the top, partially peeled off. It has metal carrying handles at either end and a pair of hook latches at the front. There is a keyhole in the front of the box. The instrument is supported inside the box by wooden fixtures with green felt cushioning affixed where wooden pieces meet instrument parts. Instructions handwritten on the inside of the box tell users how to replace components. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The instrument is complete and consists of five major components. There is a large circular metal (brass) base, with three supporting feet, each of which is adjustable with a screw and can be clamped by a nut. Each foot has a pointed base. Two posts consisting of a V-shaped stand and a third perpendicular 'leg' for support sit atop the circular base. These have V-shaped openings at the top to support the telescope. The angle of one of these V-shaped openings can be adjusted turning a screw knob. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The telescope, which is painted forest green, rests in the V-shaped openings, resting on narrow cylindrical sections just inside the setting circle and at the other end of the tapered rod that tapers from a broader central section to the narrow support sections. Perpendicular to this rod is the telescope tube. This is 56cm long, with a lens diameter of 4cm, which is covered by a rotating cap that has a rotating cover with a 2.2cm opening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The setting circle is at one end of the tapered central support of the telescope. It consists of a circle made of metal with six spokes. Around the rim of this, there is a scale divided into four sets of 90 degrees. Fitted on top of this, there is a vernier arm with scales at each end that rest next to the circular scale, and a third longer arm perpendicular to that which extends beyond the edge of the circle and ends in a slightly thicker portion. Also affixed to this, there is a small bubble level. The instrument maker's name appears on the vernier arm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in the box is a large bubble level on a brass rod cut with two V-shaped slots; this appears to fit over the top of the rod that supports the telescope. In a row of seven wooden slots at the back of the instrument box, there are six bolts for assembling the instruments; one slot is empty. There is a small plastic flashlight attached to a large safety pin clip. Finally, there is an electrical connector, apparently locally made, with a textile cable and a knurled knob switch. Laid on top of the instrument there is a piece of paper containing a typed description of the instrument written by Donald A. MacRae dated December 1980.</p>

"Celestial Globe","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This instrument consists of a small globe contained in a wooden box. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The wooden box is roughly cubic, with a brass-coloured metal hand on the top and two latches on the side two hold the box closed. On the interior of the lid, there are instructions for use of the globe and slid onto a metal rod, four sliding pieces with indicator arrows that can be used to indicate points on the globe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The globe sits in the lower half of the box with a wooden surround so that only the upper hemisphere of the globe is visible. It is held in place by a circular metal ring that attaches to the top of the globe via a small metal peg that is inserted into a small hole at the 'north pole' of the globe. There was originally a matching piece affixing the ring to the south pole; this has become detached.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around the equator of the globe, affixed to the wood, there is a metal ring with a scale etched on it, in degrees of a circle. Fitted over the globe there are two half-circle rings that are fitted together at right angles at the top with a small metal ball and attached at the base by a ring, creating a hemispherical frame. This fits over the globe and can be freely lifted off and moved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The globe itself is heavy, likely made of solid wood, and the surface is cream in colour. The map is printed on varnished paper and indicates important and prominent stars and constellations. There are two small holes with a metal-lined edge in the wooden surround next to the globe.</p>

Altimeter,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a cylindrical instrument contained inside a leather case with a long strap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The leather case is cylindrical, with an open top and bottom. Looped around the exterior of the case through two loops is a narrow leather strap with a buckle at one end; the belt end of this is broken and repaired with a piece of green tape. Additional buckles are fixed to the side of the instrument, as are some additional leather straps; these are broken off at the base of the cylinder. These are likely the remnants of straps that apparently passed under the instrument to provide support underneath the instrument and allow it to be removed. The top of the case has a narrow lip around the rim and a circular metal piece inside of this into which the top edge of the instrument fits. When contained in the case, the face of the instrument is visible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The altimeter consists of a short black-lacquered brass cylinder, with a circular face covered with a clear plastic cover. The face has a double circular scale around the rim, displaying measurements from '0' to '9700', labelled in thousands and hundreds. At the centre of the face, on top of the cover, there is a ridged brass dial. A thin metal indicating needle is attached to the base of this and can be turned by turning the dial. At the top of the face, a thin filament at the top of the face moves between + and - marks to indicate the accuracy of the rotating needle's position.</p>

At least two such projectors were required to create a stereoscopic image, but the apparatus included a table, frame, cooling system, photographic printer, and other instruments. 

In order to use this instrument for cartography, aerial photographs were printed on small glass plates called diapositives using an instrument called a reduction printer. 

These small photographic plates were mounted in projectors such as this one. Each projector has six adjustable motions (x/y and z axes, and three rotational axes). The projectors were lit by powerful 24v lamps that required  air cooling.  The projectors were aligned on a horizontal bar representing the line of flight of the aircraft. [Moffitt  262] The projectors cast an image on a very level drawing surface. 

These projectors were used in sets of multiple instruments. One stereoscopic image required two projectors, one with a red filter, and one with a blue or green filter. When viewed with coloured glasses this produced a stereoscopic model or the terrain, the projectors becoming “miniature replicas of the aircraft camera”. [Tropey 131]
 
 Topography was derived from this model using a “plotting table”, or “tracing-table platen” instrument with a vertically adjustable floating mark consisting of a lighted point. The mark is used to follow the contours of the terrain of the stereoscopic models at a given height. A pencil records the movement of the plotting table. The process of tracing the contours of the stereoscopic image required operator skill. 

Cameras could be used in several overlapping pairs creating a “multiplex extension” or “bridge.

UTEM Mk3 Transmitter

This was the third transmitter prototype. The first transmitter was a one-sided current regulating transmitter with a similar time base as the receiver and peak voltages of +/-140V. The output waveform was an exact ramp. It was in a grey case of cuboid shape and may still be at U. of T.

There is a photo of it in my thesis. The second transmitter (UTEM II) was built by Geonics as part of the WBTD and then heavily modified by me to stabilize its operation when driving a realistic inductive loop. It was packaged in an orange colour case with additional circuitry such that the lid could not be closed. It may also still be at U. of T.

The UTEM Mk3 transmitter was built later in the WBTD project prior to a series of more demanding field surveys. This transmitter was optimized for use with larger loops. It featured higher power, the use of switch-mode regulated power supplies and differential drive output producing a much higher peak output voltage swing of +/- 285V and peak current of 5A.

UTEM is a ground-based (as opposed to aircraft based) transient electromagnetic system (TEM). Electromagnetic prospecting technologies emerged after the Second World War in Canada and Scandinavia, where generally resistive environments made them practicable. 

TEM systems were an evolution of the earlier electromagnetic prospecting systems that took advantages of advances in electronics in order to apply the technology to more challenging environments while producing more interpretable data. The purpose of the UTEM project at the University of Toronto was to “measure directly the magnetic and electric fields induced by a fixed transmitter system in the ground over a relatively wide band of frequencies.” [Lamontagne 1975, 5]

The UTEM system uses a generator-driven transmitter coil to induce a secondary (transient) field in conductive minerals. These transients are detected and recorded using a mobile receiver coil and meter. 

The UTEM system was developed by Dr. Yves Lamontagne and his graduate supervisor, Professor Gordon F. West, at the Geophysics Laboratory of the University of Toronto. The system was meant to be readily adaptable to commercial surveys.  Dr. Lamontagne completed his thesis in 1975. In 1979, he established the Lamontagne Geophysics in Toronto, Ontario. In 1990, the company moved to Kingston, Ontario.

UTEM II receiver

This is the second UTEM prototype receiver built at the University of Toronto geophysics laboratory. The first prototype (UTEM 1) was built for my Ph. D. research project. It may still be at U. of T. or it may have been scavenged for building other prototypes. The UTEM 1 receiver was mostly analogue using synchronous rectifier diode bridge switches for channel sampling and LSTTL logic for timing circuitry.

The UTEM II receiver was built as part of the Wideband Time-Domain EM Project (WBTD) at U of T, which was supported by a consortium of mining companies. This receiver introduced digital recording on a cassette tape recorder. It used hard-wired digital circuitry for timing stacking and a dividing DAC for live monitoring of the averaged stacked data. Channel timing was controlled by a time base clocked by an oversized crystal oscillator.

UTEM I coil sensor

Two prototype coil sensors were used for UTEM research at U. of T. The first one was inherited from an AMT research project (Andrew Koziar/David Redmond). It was made mainly of acrylic plastic and was short-lived. It fell on a rock and broke in the first test UTEM I survey at the Cavendish EM test site.

It was replaced by the more rugged UTEM I coil sensor which was built with multiple sections of windings on a long core and incorporating active guarding to improve the resonant frequency. The gain of the original sensor was subject to gain variations mainly due to temperature changes. There were attempts to add compensation circuitry with thermistors to correct this variation to first order. The sensor is corroded as it was dropped in streams and beaver dams on a few occasions. It was also dropped down a cliff once and flew apart which may be how the outer tube was lost.

The Aerochamber divided this process into two discreet steps; the user would release the medication into the chamber through a one-way valve. The user could then inhale the medication when they were ready.

The Aerochamber originally designed Dr. D. Corr and his collaborators at McMaster University. It was first described by Dr. Corr et all in 1980 (see References). Dr. Mike Newhouse of McMaster University later commercialized the Aerochamber in collaboration with Trudel Instruments. This launched the development of a series of Aerochamber-type instruments that are documented in this collection. 

Dr. Stanley Epstein's earlier clinical research on the misuse of the metered dose inhaler (Epstein et al. 1979) led to a collaboration with Dr. Newhouse to test the Aerochamber for correcting the user errors documented in these trials. This prototype Instrument was developed for these clinical trials carried out at the University of Toronto (see Epstein et al. 1983). These trials were inconclusive, likely due in part to the large doses that were characteristic of metered dose inhalers at that point as even an improperly used inhaler would have delivered an effective amount of medicine. 

Further trials were carried out by Dr. Newhouse in collaboration with Dr. John Toogood at the University of Western Ontario in London Ontario. These showed that long-term user of the chamber by asthmatic patients using inhaled corticosteroids led to fewer pharyngeal fungal infections (oral thrush). These successful trials led to the subsequent commercialization of the technology.",,,,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/wpm_instrument/prototype-aerochamber/,publish

"Glass Slides Depicting Concentric Circles","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This object consists of a blue repurposed jewellery box containing five glass slides wrapped in a scrap of paper. The jewellery box is from Ryrie & Birks and has a larger lid, hinged that opens on a smaller base. The inside of the lid contains a satin-like lining. </p>

The centre rings are wider, and there is a large space in the centre of each pattern which does not contain circles. On the four smaller slides, the circular pattern is centred in a black surround; on the larges the slide, the circular shape overlaps the edges of the exposed edges. The slides appear to have been cut down to size by hand. One of the slides has a border formed of cut stickers taped around the edge of the pattern.</p>

He did postgraduate work at the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington before receiving a position there. His early focused on the rubidium–strontium (Rb-Sr) and strontium-strontium method of radioisotope dating. He later turned his attention to uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating.

In 1973, Tom Krogh published a seminal paper that introduced a new sample preparation technique known as hydrothermal decomposition and chemical purification that greatly simplified the process of U-Pb dating while reducing lead contamination by an order of magnitude. (See Krogh 1973 and Kamo et al. 2011)  

In 1975, Krogh accepted an offer to establish a new lab at the Royal Ontario Museum. The position was supported by the Geological Survey of Canada. In 1982, while working at the ROM, Krogh developed a superior method of preparing zircon crystals based on air abrasion (see Krogh 1982). This became a standard laboratory method. Air abrasion has been succeeded by the chemical abrasion (“CA-TIMS”) method of zircon preparation that was first published in 2005.

In 2004, Krogh’s ROM U-Pb lab was transferred to the University of Toronto Department of Earth Sciences, where it remains a leading laboratory for U-Pb dating.",,,,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/wpm_instrument/krogh-air-abrasion-chamber-for-u-pb-dating/,publish

""It sounds like the best description would be that this glassware was likely used for a phase-equilibrium experiment.

""My initial idea was that was a replacement apparatus for experiment P2, boiling point behaviour of a two component one phase system, but there don't appear to be sampling ports -- or at least not well designed ones.  It's certainly to do with measuring a boiling point of a fluid in some way -- the crowfoot heater will boil the liquid which goes up the vertical Cottrell pump tube (where liquid and vapour come to equilibrium) and sprays onto a thermometer well.  I can't quite see if the condensate then returns to the boiling chamber, or if there's a trap there.""",,,"Erich Weidenhammer",1,1,2018-06-18,2018-06-18,,,,,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/wpm_instrument/glass-apparatus-for-phase-equilibrium-experiment/,publish

<p>This is a Polaroid Camera (2019.ast.165.1) with 3-inch lens (2019.ast.165.2) and two ratio multiplers (2019.ast.165.3-4). The camera itself is a flat rectangular box with a back that can be opened via a metal latch on the base; this reveals the film compartment. On one side of the camera there is a plastic handle for carrying the camera. On the other there is the slot into which film can be slid into the camera. On top of the camera there is a slide attachment for a flash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fixed to the front of the camera there is a tapering plastic box with a large shutter opening on the front. This shutter can be opened and closed by way of a rotating dial reading ""LOCK"" and ""OPEN"", which also operates the latches that hold this portion of the camera to either other ratio multiplier boxes, or the lens assembly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This latch also enables the affixing of additional ratio multiplier boxes (2019.ast.165.3-4) to the camera, in order to increase the distance between the lens and the camera. There are two identical ratio multiplier boxes attached to this camera, both with shutters that are open when the ratio multiplers are locked to the camera, and closed when they are separated and the dials are set to open. Both ratio multipliers have screw holes in the base. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final box is attached to the camera in the same way, and contains the 3-inch lens (2019.ast.165.2). This box has a square opening on the top, through which the lens is visible and can be adjusted via various protruding handles on the dial. On the base of this box there is a metal latch; pulling this latch mechanically opens the shutter, which can be held open as long as the latch is pulled. On one side of this box there is a four-pronged male plug into which permits the camera shutter to be connected to the CU-5 Power Pack. Around the front rim of the lens there is a plastic ring, which contains a circular flash-bulb.</p>

<p>The instrument itself is roughly the shape of a right-angle triangle, with an eyepiece on the one side through which a bubble is visible. On one side of this blocky triangle there is a plastic tube with an unscrewable cap and a notched wheel. At the front of the triangle there is a large round cylindrical piece on the front of which there is a rotating key and an indicator arrow, and on one side a window with rotating dial indicating numbers. Also attached to this there is a metal loop with a trigger-like latch. On the other side of the sextant there a number of knobs, indicators, and switches. These include: a rotating dial cut with holes of different aperture, a knob named ""DEG."", a switch marked ""INCREASE"" that alters other indicators on the instrument and a a flat beige plastic section divided into four section on which is written ""OBJECT"" ""START"" ""FINISH"" ""ALTITUDE"" for recording observations. </p>

"Hooker 100-inch Telescope Model","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The object is a model of the Hooker 100-inch Telescope from the Mount Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles, California. The model is composed of a grey rectangular wooden base, two green and grey wooden vertical supports at either end of the base, and the body of the telescope, which consists of a green rectangular frame and a hollow cylindrical apparatus constructed from green and grey wood, and green and white metal. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rectangular frame is held by the two vertical supports. The frame can be rotated to mimic how the real telescope would move horizontally to view different parts of the sky. The sides of the frame are attached to the base of the long cylindrical apparatus, which represents the part of the telescope that would house the lens. The cylinder is constructed of a series of long white metal rods held in place by white and green metal circles. The frame and cylinder are attached at the cylinder's base by a nut and bolt on both sides of the frame. Each bolt also attaches to a long green metal rod on the outside of the wooden frame. Threaded through a small box and held in place by two screws, the rod can be moved - moving the cylinder with it - to mimic how the real telescope would be moved up and down in order to examine different portions of the sky. When the screws are tightened, the rods and the cylinder are held in place.</p>

"Weight-Driven Clock Drive","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This object is kept in a pale-coloured wooden box with a blue David Dunlap Observatory label on the top. The instrument inside is basically rectangular, with metal sides and base, and front, top and base clear plastic. On the top of the box there is a round dial on which is written ""FAST"" and ""SLOW"". Visible inside the box is a centrifugal governor with three balls. Below this there is a gear system connected to a ridged wheel around which is wrapped a length of thick metal wire. This end of this wire, coiled into a loop, emerges through a rectangular window cut in the plastic side of the box. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the left and right of the box there are metallic attachments that connect to the mechanism on the interior. On one side there is a square rod to which a separable two ended handle can be attached to enable the coil inside to be rewound. On the other side of the box, there is a small metal box to which is attached a jointed metallic arm which ends in an open tube; the angle of this box can be adjusted and fixed in place. This appears to be a coupling device to connect the instrument to another instrument such as a telescope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a cylindrical metal piece with a hook on one end which perhaps is intended to to be hooked onto the metal wire to prevent the wire being retracted into the box of the instrument.</p>

"Plate Measuring Machine","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This object looks like a large brass microscope. It consists of a heavy black base with two feet. Rising from this there is a support cylindrical tube with several sections supporting two assemblies of instruments. This tube is hinged just below the stage; it can be tilted so the stage and lens tilts towards the viewer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stage of the microscope, mounted about a third of the way up the tube, consists of several layers: at the base, a flat metal support with an adjustable mirror attachment below it. Mounted directly on this, a rectangular box-type structure with a round hole cut in the base. This contains a smaller box which contains a screw which turned by a set of gears and graduated knobs. At the other end, the smaller box is attached to a string which emerges from a small hole in the end of this box. This large and smaller box arrangement serves as the 'rail' and 'carriage' which permits the assembly on top be moved left and right in very fine increments using the knobs. This top section includes the glass stage; here, two rotating flaps can be moved to hold a sample or slide; the glass in place can be slid out to permit another piece, such as a slide, to be slid in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mounted at the top of the support tube of the microscope directly over the stage there is a second cylindrical piece containing the lenses. This can be adjusted via a pair of large knobs on either side of the tube.</p>

Radial velocity is the movement of a celestial objects along the observer's line of sight, either approaching or receding from the observer. If a star is approaching, the Doppler Effect causes the wavelengths of elemental lines to shift quantifiably towards the blue end of the electromagnetic spectrum, and if a star is receding the lines appear to shift towards the red end of the spectrum. This allows the velocity of a star to be determined relative to the observer or another frame of reference. Programs amassing stellar radial velocities were important for statistically exploring galactic dynamics, morphology, stellar pulsation and atmospheres, and the orbits of spectroscopic binary stars (technical innovations over the last thirty years have rendered radial-velocity detection a leading technique for exoplanet discovery). Similar instruments to the Toepfer were used at observatories from ca. 1900-1965, concurrently with the introduction of ever more sophisticated measuring machines.""","Very Good: This instrument is in very good condition. In places, its metallic surfaces are scratched and corroded, but on the whole the metal is on good condition. Exceptions include the flaps designed to hold the slide in place, and the arm which permits the tilting of the microscope, which are more badly corroded. The mirror at the base is cracked across one side and somewhat scratched and corroded. 

Most of the parts of the instrument are present, including all the lenses. The string emerging from the sliding carriage is not attached to anything.",,"Otto Toepfer &amp;amp; Sohn","c. 1905-1915","This instrument was likely acquired for astronomical work at the University of Toronto at the beginning of the 20th century. It may have been used into the 1930s, and may therefore have been used at the David Dunlap Observatory. If so, it was stored there until 2009, when the Observatory was closed, when it would have been moved to the Department of Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics at the U of T St George Campus.

Heliostat,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a brass instrument on a circular base with three screw legs. The instrument is has a central stand which is cut open at the base to reveal a glass disc fixed flat in the base of the stand. Above this, there is a cylindrical stand with a knob enabling the rotating instrument to be fixed in place. Above this, a brass piece holds a circular rotating assembly: this has a central semi-circular piece with a graduated scale around its rim, and a long arm with a u-shaped attachment at the end. This is attached by a rod to a clockwork motor that turns the rotating piece slowly. The clockwork motor has a key to wind it up, and two switches, one that permits shifting between ""A"" and ""R"" settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also attached to the central stand there is an arm that supports a rectangular mirror. This can be lengthened, and rotates smoothly around the stand; the mirror's angle can be adjusted in any direction via a ball joint. Behind the mirror there is a round knob for adjustments. At one end of the mirror, a long rod emerges; this is intended to be fixed to the arm attached to the rotating clockwork assembly with the u-shaped attachment, but is currently free.</p>

<p>This object is a crudely made metal box taller than it is wide with an open top. The box is painted khaki green. One side of the box is higher than the others, and cut with a round hole, as if the object could be attached to a vertical surface, such as a wall. Dangling inside the box from a horizontal metal rod there is a piece of beige fabric that has been roughly sewn onto the rod. This dangles down the centre of the box right to the base. On the fabric and inside the box there is a quantity of residue from a dried substance. This also seems to have contributed to corrosion around the edges of the box. The fabric is torn at the edges, and has holes worn in it.</p>

"Telescope Mount","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A brass stand on a heavy iron tripod base. At the top of the stand there are two v-shaped holders to cup a telescope. Beneath this there is a knurled knob; when loosened, this allows the holders and the support below to rotate, also turning a long metal pointer. This pointer rests on a graduated section that sticks out from the stand perpendicularly. It is graduated from 0 (at one edge), to 30 (at another), with 15 in the middle. </p>

""...the argon-40/argon-39 dating method requires neutron irradiation of the samples in a reactor before argon analysis. This produces the radioactive isotopes Ar-37 and Ar-39, both of which we measured, along with the naturally occurring Ar-36, Ar-38 and Ar-40, to determine the age and certain correction factors required for the calculation (and also producing, as a by-product, the K/Ca ratio of the material emitting the argon at a given sample temperature).  To do the calculation involving the radioactive isotopes, we must know the time interval between irradiation and analysis.  Each irradiation of a group of samples is assigned an internal irradiation number, such as P36, which is attached to all samples in that irradiation. At least most of the notes simply record the date of a given irradiation, to be entered in for the analysis. A ""Cd"" indicates that a sheet of cadmium surrounding the samples was added to the sample container at the reactor before the irradiation (and removed there before shipping back to us; it becomes quite radioactive) to absorb the low-energy ""thermal"" neutrons and reduce the corrections that need to be applied in the age calculation.""",UTSIC,,"Erich Weidenhammer, Sophie LeBlanc",1,1,2018-10-10,2018-10-10,,,"Detached label has been stored the with condition report.",,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/wpm_instrument/console-for-laser-heated-rare-gas-mass-spectrometer/,publish

Sample spikes have been marked in the following format. (""xx"" corresponds to a particular sample number listed on the box lid.). On the tube in permanent marker: ""AD-xx"". On the masking tape label, in blue pen: ""A 38 Spike AD-xx"".

The masking tape label on the residue spike is labelled as follows: ""Residue A38 Spike  AD-Split Aug 2/85"".","Cardboard case is: Height = 7, Width = 7, Length = 32; Sample Tubes: Length ~17.5, Max Diameter = 1; Residue Spike: Length ~15.5, Max Diameter = 3.5.","These samples were part of the potassium-argon (K-Ar) analysis process. 

These argon spikes were attached to a large, branching manifold, where they were filled from a sample of enriched argon 38 before being sealed and detached. 

Argon from individual spikes was combined with argon obtained from a dating sample. The argon content of the dating sample was then determined through isotope dilution analysis using a mass spectrometer.","Good. The tubes appear to be undamaged. The cardboard labels are drying out and may become detached.",,"York K-Ar Laboratory,  Jack Legge glassblower at the Department of Physics.","c. 2 August, 1985.","This box was among a number of artefacts collected from the Potassium-Argon dating laboratory, founded by Professor Derek York (1936-2007), on Friday, July 24th 2015.  The laboratory was removed shortly after.",,"The process in which these artefacts were used was described in email correspondence between Dr. Chris Hall, of the University of Michigan Dept. of Earth and Environmental Sciences. Hall, who worked in Derek York's Laboratory, describes the spikes and follows in an email dated 7 October 2018:

""Individual spikes were ""single use"" spikes that would be combined with the Ar from an individual sample. And yes, this was to work out the sample's argon volume using isotope dilution.

The single use spikes were made from the expansion of gas from a higher pressure spike using a large glass tree-like structure. The gas was moved around by flooding different parts of the structure with mercury. The gas that wasn't compressed into the individual spikes was then saved in a separate residual spike. That residual spike would then be used to create another next batch of spikes. It was necessary to keep careful track of the volumes of gas in each tube.

I can see a small droplet of mercury in the breakseal area of the residue tube. I'm not sure what the black spot is, but it might be a level mark left by a felt tip pen(?). It's also quite possible that the tube would have a tiny piece of activated charcoal. When cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures, this would pump all of the argon back into the tube. It's sort of a very cheap cryo pump.
I never saw John Kenyon ship out Ar-38 spikes, but I'm pretty sure that the original spikes were made by gaseous diffusion techniques in Switzerland. It would make sense to pit a cork in the tube to protect the breakseal from accidental breakage.""",IHPST,,"Erich Weidenhammer",1,1,2018-09-26,2018-09-26,"These glass sample spikes represent the potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating process used in Professor Derek York's laboratory before the adoption of argon-argon (Ar-Ar) process.",,,,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/wpm_instrument/argon-sample-spikes/,publish

During this process, the column assembly was removed from the pressure vessel and shipped to High Voltage Engineering Europa in the Netherlands.

Researchers and technicians at the University of Toronto undertook to solve inaccuracies in the accelerator tube caused by around 150 glue joints which together caused a misalignment of around 2mm at the high voltage terminal. This sag was initially counteracted with a tension bar made of Delrin and stainless steel. In the new arrangement, installed during the upgrade process, a new insulator was installed that supported the tube and stripper housing assembly at its centre. 

The addition of this new insulator required considerable modification to the top high voltage terminal cover plate.

HCLs are used in atomic analysis instruments such as the atomic absorption spectrometer. The sealed glass tube contains an inert gas such as argon or neon.

This ionized gas is accelerated towards the cathode, which sputters atoms off the sample element at the cathode. These freed atoms are excited by collisions within the plasma.

"Isotrace Radial Beam Pulse Tetrode","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tetrode is mounted on a silver metal base. On the bottom of this base are five cylindrical metal pins, arranged in a circle. There are several circular holes on the bottom of the base as well. This base is designed to fit snugly into a fixture.<br />
Secured to this base is a large, dark grey, metallic object with long fins. It is wide, but narrows at the top, where it connects to a thin blue cylindrical piece. All of this is covered by a glass casing, which forms the vacuum tube. Above the casing is the plate, a metal cap with a point on top which receives the charge from the apparatus within the vacuum tube and carries it to the rest of the machine.<br />
This glass casing is mostly clear, but it has been darkened somewhat, and a particularly pronounced dark band has formed in a circle at the midpoint of the tube. This tetrode is designed to operate at temperatures between one and two hundred degrees, and the marks might be the result of burns from sustained heating.</p>

The amplifier unit is roughly rectangular with curved corners and encased in silver metal. Attached to one side, there is a metal clip, so the item can be clipped to clothing. At the base of the control unit, there is a deep red plastic section. Attached to the base of this there is a metal cover that is attached by a pin at one end, permitting it to swing open. This reveals a cylindrical opening for a battery with a yellow sticker inside indicating which way around the battery should be inserted, and a small beige plastic section with tiny round holes in it, each of which has a different colour interior and is labelled with a different letter: ""T"" ""V"" and ""B"".

At the other, slightly narrower, end of the control unit there are a number of protruding switches, dials and sockets, each one in deep red plastic. One, on the side of the unit, is a slide switch which is labelled ""M"" at one end and ""T"" at the other. On the corner of the unit, there is a rounded knob, also a slide switch; this is unlabelled. On the other corner of the unit, there is a ridged wheel that protrudes slightly from the instrument. This is numbered in regular intervals from 1 to 5. On the top of the instrument, there is a socket for a flat multi-pinned plug.

Emerging from this narrower end of the unit, there is a length of wire. This consists of two thin wires insulated in white plastic that are coiled together. Attached to the end of this wire, there is a roughly cylindrical attachment consisting of a beige plastic backing, a cylindrical metal section and a small raised cylindrical middle section with a small round hole in the middle of it.

<p>The Callendar and Griffiths bridge is contained in a 50cm-long, 27cm-wide and 17cm-tall wooden box with a 7cm-tall lockable and openable lid. The body of the bridge itself is 46cm long, 23cm wide and 10cm tall and it is fixed on a 49cm-long and 26cm-wide wooden board. Unlike more contemporary and newer versions of Callendar and Griffiths bridges, the external box and the bridge itself are not seamlessly fitted between each other. Instead, there is a gap between the bridge and the inner sides of the box. There was a brass hinge in the lower-left corner of the box in the aforementioned gap, allowing the bridge to be lifted out of the box while secured by the hinge. The panel of the bridge is consisted of three parts. Two parallel brass rods outside and two iron alloy strings inside together form a rail on the lower side of the panel, allowing a jockey sliding from left to right. In the middle there are eight brass terminals with plastic-capped switches. Different readings are marked on the brass terminal seats as well on the corresponding plastic caps: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280. On the upper side there are eight brass coils.</p>

<p>The object consists of a long wooden box, lined on one side with ten identical bronze switches. These switches consist of bronze arms that can swing down into a bronze fixture to complete a circuit and allow the flow of current. The arms all have black plastic caps that have a logo consisting of a T in a circle. Each switch is mounted on a rectangular black metal piece, to which they are secured by screws. a length of wire runs along the bottoms of the switches, connecting all of them together in series and to a metal fixture at the end of the row with a removable metal hook. There is a similar fixture above it, except that this hook has a red handle. Each switch also has a metal wire at its top, which runs through a small hole into the box.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The box's top is a separate piece of wood that has been affixed to the bottom by metal hinges on the side of the switches and secured to it on the other side by latches, which can be opened. Inside the box, there are twenty-one smaller boxes made of black-painted metal, arranged in three rows of seven. Some of these have number-letter combinations written on their surfaces. All boxes have two circular holes in their tops, out of which extend small flat pieces of metal. These pieces are soldered to metal bars which connect all of the batteries in a row. The wires from the switches on the outside of the box are also soldered to different parts of this metal box. At one end of the rows are four cylindrical pieces that connect to some of the wires. Small wooden pieces are placed between the metal boxes and the edge of the wooden box in order to make up excess space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The box does not appear to be a commercially available instrument, and likely is locally made. The pieces of wood filling the space suggest that the components were not designed specifically to fit together, and there are no visible logos or trademarks (other than the T's in a circle on the switches, but these could be the brand of the switches themselves).</p>

Paul Beaudouin was the nephew of Charles Beaudouin, who had first established a Paris-based instrument manufacturing enterprise around 1914. 

The instrument was ani mprovement over earlier micromanipulators in the sense that the controller permitted easy and intuitive control across three axes. For instance, the  &amp;lt;a href="" https://utsic.escalator.utoronto.ca/home/blog/instrument/chambers-micromanipulator/""&amp;gt;Chambers' Micromanipulator&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, developed around 1918, required that each axis be controlled separately using an adjustment screw.

De Fonbrune and his colleagues at the Institut Pasteur developed a number of related technologies, including a specialized microforge for creating various glass microtools and an oil-based moist chamber that prevented evaporation of the suspension liquid when working with organic samples.",,,,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/wpm_instrument/de-fonbrune-micromanipulator/,publish

Personal narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of the New continent, during the years 1799-1804, by A. von Humboldt and A. Bonpland. translated from the French by Helen Maria Williams, 1814, p 36.) Helferich notes in Humboldt's Cosmos that Humboldt made 124 magnetic observations on his expedition.

""Immediately after leaving Europe, Humboldt began taking regular measurements of the earth’s magnetic field, using a kind of vertical compass called a dip needle. During the course of his journey, he made 124 magnetic observations ranging over 115 degrees of longitude and 64 degrees of latitude, also recording in every case the geodetic coordinates, height above sea level, and distance from any mountains or prominent rocks that might influence the results. As he traveled south toward the geographic equator, he noted with increasing excitement a steady decrease in the earth’s magnetic field. Even after Humboldt crossed the geographic equator in Ecuador, the magnetic dip—the angle with which the magnetic needle was attracted downward, toward the earth, continued to decline. But now, as the party traversed the Cajamarca Plateau, he finally registered a dip of zero: He had located the magnetic equator—the line where the vertical component of earth’s magnetic force is zero—at 7 degrees, 27 minutes south latitude and 81 degrees, 8 minutes west longitude. ... Humboldt’s discovery of the magnetic equator on the desolate Cajamarca Plateau was a landmark achievement, not only proving that the earth’s magnetic field varies predictably with latitude but pinpointing the exact location where there is no vertical dip at all. 'I have considered the law of the decrease of the magnetic forces from the pole to the equator as the most important result of my American journey,' Humboldt wrote.""

""For many, receiving a prosthetic limb is a difficult task, with cost and time being primary obstacles to proper fit and comfort. This problem is especially apparent in the developing world, where there are fewer trained prosthetists per patient than in elsewhere. This problem also disproportionately affects children, as their naturally high growth rate means they outgrow sockets within months. ""

PrintAbility is a project aimed at solving this problem, and works with children in Uganda. The goal of the project is to scan and 3D-print fully-customized and low-cost below-the-knee sockets for children at all stages in their development. In addition, the team worked with their collaborators, and with technicians in Uganda to bring and adapt 3D scanning and printing know-how to local settings. The process to create a prosthetic could be greatly reduced using this technology, as described in a Toronto Star article: 

""First a prosthetic technician uses a device that looks like a staple gun to scan the limb. The data gathered is sent to a laptop with a graphic processor. A software program called Meshmixer, developed by University of Toronto PhD computer science student Ryan Schmidt, turns the 3D scanned data into something printable. The socket itself is designed in Meshmixer and the custom software developed by the team. Six to nine hours later, a socket — 3D-printed using a bioplastic, polylactic acid and designed specifically for the patient — is ready.""

"Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This object consists of a long rectangular wooden box containing four smaller long thin boxes, each containing a series of cylindrical tiles displaying different colour hues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The container box is made of wood with a particle board base, with a metal handle at one end. A ridge along the interior top edge and end indicates that the box originally had a sliding lid; however, this is missing and the box is open. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This box contains four long thin boxes that when they are all loaded in the box fill the box space entirely. Each box is closed by two metal latches and labelled with a metal label marked with two numbers: ""22-42"", ""43-63"", ""64-84"" and ""84-21"". The ""64-84"" box is also marked with a pink sticker ""Neutrals"". The interior of each box is painted black.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each box opens to reveal a line of round tiles consisting of a black cylindrical plastic housing with a circular opening in the top. Affixed inside this there is a piece of cardboard painted or printed on the upper side with a particular colour, so when the tiles are upright, the colour is visible in a black surround. The black pieces are open on the bottom revealing the underside of the card; each card is stamped with a different number, indicating its order. In each box there are 23 colour cylinders, except for the first box (marked ""85-21"") which contains 24 cylinders. The first and last cylinder in each box is fixed in place and appears to be a replica of the lowest and highest numbers in the box. 85 is located in the first (""85-21"") box, although it most closely matches the colour of the final fixed cylinder in the ""64-84"" box. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hues in the boxes are arranged in an order that shows a smooth circular colour gradient from hue 1 to 85 (hue ""85"" is similar to hue ""1""). Hues 1-21 are reds to yellow-green, 22-42 are greens to aquas, 43-63 are aquas to purples, and 64-84 are purples to reds.</p>

Handwritten on a large pink paper label on the ""64-84"" box: ""Neutrals"".","Length = 60, Width = 16, Height = 6.5cm","The Farnsworth–Munsell 100 Hue Color Vision test was first described by Dean Farnsworth in 1943 (""The Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue and Dichotomous Tests for Color Vision""). It is designed to test colour vision by the arrangement of hues in a consistent order. The original article describes the test's purpose: ""The purpose of the test is  to measure hue discrimination in a  curve of constant value and chroma and thereby indicate the distortion of the chromaticity plane of anomalous vision as com-pared to normal."" (Farnsworth, 1943)

This test is an early 85-tile version of the test.","Very Good: The surface of the corners and edges of the wooden container box are damaged. The lid of the container box is missing. The handle shows a large number of scratches in the enamel coating; where the coating has been removed, the metal is oxidized. The upper part of the left-hand metal latch on box ""43-63"" is missing its right-hand screw and is loose. The upper part of the right hand latches on boxes ""22-42"" and ""85-21"" are missing.  

The tiles contained in the boxes are in very good condition. Some have very minor marks and damage to the hue surface.",,,1940s-1980s,,,"Albert H. Munsell developed the colour system employed in this test at the beginning of the 20th century, defining three qualities of colour: hue, value (lightness), and chroma (Munsell, 1912). This system was used throughout the 20th century to analyze and categorize colour.

Although this hue test is based on a 100-hue series of colored papers based on Munsell's system and selected into a consistent set in 1940 by Dorothy Nickerson and Walter Granville (Nickerson &amp;amp; Granville, 1940), Farnsworth found that a hundred hues was too high a level of difficulty for a normal user due to production difficulties in producing a smooth gradient of colour. He developed an 85-tile system which could be completed successfully by a normal user. Nevertheless, the ""100"" name was retained, Farnsworth writing: ""While 85 papers constitute the present form of the test further efforts to smooth the series will change the number. Therefore, the number in the basic series is retained in the name of the test."" This test is an example of the 85-tile system proposed in 1943.

From 1936, John Goodwin, who had an engineering background, was a technical research assistant at the Banting Institute. Over the next few years, he became closely involved with the construction of the earliest EEG machines at the Institute and is named in the U of T Report to the Board of Governors of 1938 as the constructor of a similar Instrument:

""Mr. J. Goodwin, Mr. D. Lloyd and Dr. Hall have studied the changes in the bio-electric potentials as recorded from the exposed area striata of the cortex during similarly produced shock. These potentials were recorded on the electro-encephalogram which has been constructed in this Department by Mr. Goodwin.

This work was interrupted by the Second World War. During the war, John Goodwin became one of those working, alongside Frederick Banting and some of his colleagues on the EEG machine projects, on Aviation Medicine--specifically noise and noise reduction for pilots (Canadian Research in Aviation Medicine by C.B. Stewart in the Nova Scotia Medical Bulletin, April 1947 vol. XXVI No. 4, pg 90).

<p>This object is a scale model of the 74-inch reflecting telescope at the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto at Richmond Hill, Ontario. The model is 1/30th the size of the real telescope. The most notable feature of the object is a scale model of the reflector telescope. This telescope is tube shaped, made of wood and painted grey in colour. The reflector telescope is articulated and rotates on an axis. This model has a handle at the end of the telescope to assist the rotation of the long tube. The mount of the telescope features two spectrographs attached at the Cassegrain focus and the Cassegrain-mounted Echelle. This section of the mount is painted light blue with four screws painted orange. The entire model is attached to a wooden, rectangular base that is also painted a grey colour.</p>

The Librarian at the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, Lee Robbins, was contacted and asked if she knew anything about the model or was aware of any records that mentioned the model. Lee Robbins explained that the department does not have good circumstantial provenance for most of the astronomy artifacts. After talking with some of the faculty, Robbins reported that the model for the DDO telescope was probably constructed in the machine shop at the David Dunlap Observatory. She also stated that is it is likely professors from the University of Toronto Department of Astronomy and the David Dunlap Observatory used the model as a teaching tool to demonstrate the telescope function, size of the tub, mount and mirror among other facts. Lee Robbins also mentioned that current faculty remember that John F Heard (appointment term: 1941-1976) used models for teaching. He served as Chair of the Department of Astronomy and DDO Director from 1951-1952 (acting) and 1952-1965.",,,,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/wpm_instrument/model-telescope-ddo/,publish

The model is composed of 10 x 15 cm wooden base with a central wooden pillar topped with a metal geared mechanism, holding a small rod at an angle. Attached to the small rod is a larger wooden rod, fitted with metal rings, representing the telescope. The whole model and mechanism is painted dark green with a glossy finish. The telescope mechanism is articulated and the rods can each be rotated to position the model. A human figurine, made of metal, stands at the base of the model for scale.

These pipes are intended to be used with bunsen burners, a stand, a windchest and a rotating mirror. The mirror, when turned, enables a viewer to perceive the modulations in the flame that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.

According to ""Altered Sensations"" by David Pantalony (New York: Springer, 2009), ""A thin membrane divided the capsule into two parts: one part was open to the sound vibrations under study; the other was closed to a flow of gas that came in through an input and exited through a gas jet, which was lit creating a tiny candle-sized flame. The membrane picked up vibrations in the air and transferred these vibrations to the gas, which caused the flame to flicker.” (pg 317).

With multiple pipes, the system allowed the comparison of tones:

""Both pipes rested vertically in a wind-chest and each had a capsule attached to the middle of the pipe. Each capsule had a rubber gas input tube and an output tube that connected to a stand for the burners, which were placed one on top of the other. A rotating mirror sat adjacent to the stand in order to pick up the signal from the burners. Two ut3 pipes, for example, displayed identical flame signals. Other combinations demonstrated the differences between octaves, thirds, fifths, etc."" (Pantalony, pg 319).","Good. All the pipes have some wear on the edges and corners.

"Portable Radiotelephone","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leather-covered wooden case is a reddish-orange colour with brass-like metal closures and metal parts attached to the the left and right side faces. Case has a front pocket that opens to about 4 cm wide and can be closed using two metal button-like snaps, one on each side of the pocket. Each case has a handle on the top and can be identified as belonging to U of T's zoology department by plastic, embossed labels adhered to the top, left side of the case's lid. The logo for Spilsbury and Tindall Ltd. Radio Communications is printed in red, white, and black, onto the front face of the lid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The front pocket contains an instruction manual for the ""PORTABLE RADIOTELEPHONE"".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside the case there are two compartments, separated by a piece of aluminum that is attached to the inside of the case. The larger compartment on the right of the case holds the radio and the smaller compartment on the left side of the case holds the battery, a plug-like cord, and a small, dark gray speaker piece (5.6 x 5.5 x 2.6 cm) that is attached to the frontal face of the radio by a cord wrapped in faded black fabric. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The front face of the radio that faces out of the case when opened, is white-flecked green in colour with a series of 6 black knobs protruding from its surface. Also protruding from the radio are a blue, plug-like hexagonal shape with 7 prongs coming out of it. There is also a white metre-like object near the bottom-centre of the radio, a metal dial in the top right corner, and a snap in the top left corner that snaps into a leather piece attached just left of the centre of the case's inner hinge. The middle and top centre of the radio is occupied by what looks like a speaker. The radio can only be taken halfway out of the case, but one can see that it consists of a metal skeleton with its inner-workings soldered together (no circuit-board) and completely open to the viewer's eye (no casing).</p>

"Monroe Nixie Tube Calculator","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Monroe Nixie Tube Calculator is a plastic instrument that has components in both an off-white color and a dark brown/black color. The front of the instrument consists of a box-like shape with a large portion cut away to make an ""L"" shape when viewed from the side. Vent holes in a grid shape have been cut into the plastic in the top of the instrument. On the front of the machine there is a display face for the numbers, which are housed in 14 glass tubes. The glass tubes are housed behind the plastic face. Directly below but perpendicular is a number and function key pad used for the operation of the instrument. Most of the instrument's control panel and face is a dark brown/black hard plastic. The sides, top and back of the instrument are an off-white hard plastic. The base of the instrument is a hard dark brown/black plastic with more vent holes cut into it and two metal labels. There is a grey electrical cord for the calculator which plugs the instrument into the wall in order to be able to operate the calculator.</p>

<p>This object is a piece of teaching apparatus for investigating air pressure over different locations of the surface of a wing model. It consists of two main sections connected by a number of plastic tubes, some of which are missing. The main section (21.1) is a manometer. It consists of a wooden stand holding two glass shapes. One glass piece is a vertically-supported tube with an orange rubber stopper in the top. Poking through the rubber stopper there is a small u-shaped tube open to the air.</p>

There is a long, thin metal rectangular piece attached to the aluminum mounted on the stage that moves back and forth.  There is a coil at the base of this rectangular piece. There are two wires which attach to the bottom of the stage and end in red and black prongs, which possibly were used to connect a battery to power the apparatus.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There instrument also has a triangular piece with a curved edge that is not attached to the steel frame or platform.  The curved edge of the triangular piece contains 17 small holes.  There is a small metal peg inserted into the sixth hole from the left.  Attached to this triangular piece is a long rectangular metal piece with a black insulated tip.  The long rectangular piece can move back and forth and it seems like it's movement is restricted by the placement of the small metal peg.  On the right side of the triangular piece is another wire that attaches to a metal piece with a circular loop.</p>

"Modified Spencer dissection microscope base","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The instrument has a steel H-shaped base that continues upward to support a steel rectangular platform.  There is an aluminum pole directly behind the platform and can be adjusted by rotating the metal dials located directly right and left of the pole.  The dials move the aluminum pole up and down.  Most likely an ocular and objective lens were originally attached to the aluminum rod, but were removed when the instrument was modified for another purpose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On top of the platform rests a three rectangular plastic piece: one large one and two thinner ones.  The thin rectangular plastic pieces are each located on the edge of the platform and the larger rectangular piece is placed on top of them, creating a space between the platform and the large rectangular piece.  Two insulated wires are directly underneath and attached to the large rectangular piece.  They are held in place by two more rectangular plastic pieces.  Two small wire tips that are attached to the cords, poke through the large rectangular piece.  At the end of the wires are three more wires: 2 clear ones and a purple one.  The purple wire and one of the clear ones attach to metal prongs.  It seems likely the other clear wire also was attached to a metal prong but it has since been detached.  The plastic pieces resting on the stage are most likely modifications to the original dissection microscope base.</p>

It is of interest, because it’s a very easy proof regarding the rotations of the cube or octahedron into itself. Let’s say the elements of the octahedron group are isomorphic to the symmetric group of degree four, which is the group of all permutations of four objects. In this case, the four objects are the four hollow triangles of different colours that make up this model. The hollow triangles being an equilateral triangle with a similar triangle cut out of the middle. And these triangles are fitted together so that every two of them are interlocked. By turning it around, I can bring these rotations around to itself, two or three or four different positions, to illustrate the four permutations or four rotations of the cube to itself.

It from the Platonic solids, in that the faces cross one another, so that you have the edges that count as edges, and the outermost edges and also forced edges where polygons cut through one another. There are 30 real edges and the other ones come because one pentagon is in a different plane from another, and they cut through one another along a diagonal. So you see how this has pentagons for faces, pentagrams for the vertex figure. The vertex figure is what you get if you cut off the corner. For example, a vertex figure of a cube is a triangle. So the vertex figure of this is a pentagram. So you have a pair of numbers, the first number is the number of sides to the face, and the other number is the number of faces to the vertex. Then modified here, you see 5/2, because the vertex figure is a star pentagon and not an ordinary pentagon, a pentagon of density two. So this has simple  5:5/2. 5 for the pentagon, and 5/2 for the vertex figure. And until recently, it was believed that this was only one way. About 1810 it was first noticed by a man called Poinsot, in France, and it is in the mosaic of the floor of a cathedral somewhere in Italy. Two of those historical ones are such that you have the Kepler-Poinsot solids: 5/2:5, 5/2:3, 5:5/2 and 3:5/2, and this one, which is 5:5/2, is called the great dodecahedron, and it’s reciprocal 5/2:5 is the one that has the corners of the star sticking out. “ H.S.M.

The next smallest one is called the truncated octahedron. You get that by cutting the corners off the octahedron which is particularly interesting because you have an unlimited number of them and you can fit them together in space that’s cubed. The next one is a truncated icosahedron, it has twenty hexagonal faces and corresponds to twenty triangular faces of the icosoles. It also has twelve pentagonal faces corresponding to the twelve pentagonal faces of the *hedron. This is particularly interesting because it was used within the last twenty years or so as the typical shape for a football. So the same shape as the lamp hanging in the front hall of this house (see 2015.ma.t7), and concocted by a chemist who found that one of the crystalline forms of carbon c60 which has one atom of carbon at each vertex of the truncated icosahedron.

The base is a single piece of metal made up up of a recatangular platform (182x134x12mm). Rising out of the base is a curved metal arc that is wider at the base and narrows as it reaches its apex (aprox. 160mm tall). The top of the strucutre features a whole that allows the grey metal component to pass through the center. The top of the whole in the place metal structure is hinged to the base and a bolt and screw keep it in place on the other side. </p>

"Sanborn galvanometer","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The instrument is propped upon a ledge in an upright position within a large wooden case. It has a steel body with a horizontal ocular piece on the right. Adjacent to the ocular piece is a circular glass window with another circular glass window above it.  Directly above the second glass window is a small silver knob and adjacent to it on the right is another larger silver knob. Both knobs can rotate and look like they were used to adjust the instrument in some way.  Directly below both circular glass windows is another small silver knob that is able to rotate.  Slightly above and to the left and right of this silver knob are two identical black knobs with arrows on them.  They can also rotate to the left and right.  Directly below the small silver knob is a panel that consists of three large black dials, a voltmeter, and four switches.  The three black knobs are adjacent to each other and the voltmeter is adjacent to these knobs on the right of the galvanometer. Directly below each of the dials and the voltmeter are switches that move left to right.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two identical holes in the galvanometer's base below the second and third switch on the panel.  The galvanometer is screwed onto the base but can removed from the case by sliding it out of the ledge.  On the left of the base are fragments of rubber with holes in it.  The rubber looks like it used to be a belt of some sort.  Chords are attached to the galvanometer and are located on the left of the instrument on the reverse side.  There is a lightbulb at the end of one chord.  At the end of another chord is a jack to plug something in.  Another chord ends in two adjacent rectangular plates, which are attached to the chord by a black, red, and white chord.  It looks like the galvanometer ran on electricity.  There are three prongs attached to the rectangular plates that looks like other parts can be attached to them.  To the right of the chords on the middle reverse side of the galvanometer are two adjacent large cylinders with perforated sides.  There is string that looks like it is wrapped around the cylinders underneath their perforated sides.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The galvanometer is inside a large, brown wooden case.  The front of the case has a key hole and can be removed in order to view the galvanometer inside.  The inside of the front of the case has green felt and a company mark below the green felt.  There is a handle above the key hole, on the top of the case. In the middle of the right side of the case there is a circular opening that can be covered by a silver circular covering from the inside of the case.  This circular opening lines up with the ocular piece of the galvanometer. On the lower back of the case is another circular opening that can also be covered up by a silver circular cover from the inside of the case.</p>

“The Buchler Cotlove Chloridometer is designed for accurate, rapid, and automatic analysis of chloride in biologic samples, by electrometric titration with silver ions. Titration times of 20 to 60 seconds per sample have a standard deviation of about 0.5 per cent of the mean value, and shorter times of about 5 seconds (minimum) per sample have only slightly greater variability. The method measures accurately concentrations as low as 0.25 mEq of chloride. The operation of the instrument is simple and cn be performed by personnel with limited clinical experience. Preparation of plasma, urine, or water extracts of tissue for titration requires only the addition of reagent.""

""The theory of the operation of the Chloridometer is based on established principles of coulometric generation of reagent and of amperometric indication of the end-point. A constant direct current is passed between a pair of silver generator electrodes in the generator (coulometric) circuit, causing release of silver ions into the titration solution at a constant rate. The end-point is indicated after all chloride has been precipitated, by the increasing concentration of of free silver ion which causes a rising current to flow through a pair of silver indicator electrodes and a Meter-Relay in the indicator (amperometric) circuit. At a preset increment of indicator current the relay is actuated, stopping a timer which runs concurrently with generation of silver ion. Since the rate of generation of silver ion is constant, the amount of chloride precipitation is proportional to the elapsed time.""","2016.zoo.4.1

"Variable Double Episcotister","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A brass and steel mechanism is mounted on a sturdy wooden base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mechanism consists of two brass wheels, each with two open sectors, which are attached at their centre. Their angular relationship may be changed in order to vary the size of a void space formed by their respective openings while the wheels are spinning. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind the wheels is a rotating shaft incorporating a ""spiral nut"" mechanism. Along with a movable carriage and bearing sleeve, this permits one of the brass wheels to be rotated with respect to the other while the wheels are spinning. </p>

The unit used is n and sometimes nD (the sodium D line is a standard wavelength, 589 nm, used for the refraction measurements). Since each chemical and concentration has a different refraction index, the measurement of this function is a good rating for purity and identification. 

Using the refractive index to characterize or determine purity of chemicals is not done as often anymore since there are more precise methods such as NMR spectra.  The refractive index is still an important way to measure sugar concentrations.","Fair. Green rust on metal parts.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_refractometer","Dept of Chemistry, U of Toronto",,"P Meindl",1,0,2014-06-06,2016-06-01,"""Ernst Abbe (1840–1905), working for Carl Zeiss AG in Jena, Germany in the late 19th century, was the first to develop a laboratory refractometer. These first instruments had built-in thermometers and required circulating water to control instrument and fluid temperatures. They also had adjustments for eliminating the effects of dispersion and analog scales from which the readings were taken.

In the Abbe' refractometer the liquid sample is sandwiched into a thin layer between an illuminating prism and a refracting prism. The refracting prism is made of a glass with a high refractive index (e.g., 1.75) and the refractometer is designed to be used with samples having a refractive index smaller than that of the refracting prism. A light source is projected through the illuminating prism, the bottom surface of which is ground (i.e., roughened like a ground-glass joint), so each point on this surface can be thought of as generating light rays traveling in all directions. A detector placed on the back side of the refracting prism would show a light and a dark region.

Over a century after Abbe's work, the usefulness and precision of refractometers has improved, although their principle of operation has changed very little. They are also possibly the easiest device to use for measuring the refractive index of solid samples, such as glass, plastics, and polymer films. Some modern Abbe refractometers use a digital display for measurement, eliminating the need for discerning between small graduations. However, the user still has to adjust the view to get a final reading.""

"Portable Radiotelephone","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leather-covered wooden case is a reddish-orange colour with brass-like metal closures and metal parts attached to the the left and right side faces. Case has a front pocket that opens to about 4 cm wide and can be closed using two metal button-like snaps, one on each side of the pocket. Each case has a handle on the top and can be identified as belonging to U of T's Zoology Department by plastic, embossed labels adhered to the top, left side of the case's lid. The logo for Spilsbury and Tindall Ltd. Radio Communications is printed in red, white, and black, onto the front face of the lid. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Radio consists of both a receiver and transmitter (transceiver) on a single base. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The front pocket of the case contains 5 ""electronic tube[s]"", and 2 two-pronged plug-like objects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside the lid of the case, there is paper adhered to the top inside wooden part of the lid on which instructions about how to set up and operate the radiotelephone are printed. The notation ""A1"" is printed in pencil on the larger instruction sheet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside the case there are two compartments, separated by a piece of aluminum that is attached to the inside of the case. The larger compartment on the right of the case holds the radio and the smaller compartment on the left side of the case holds the battery, a plug-like cord, and a small, dark gray speaker piece (5.6 x 5.5 x 2.6 cm) that is attached to the frontal face of the radio by a cord wrapped in faded black fabric. The radio and speaker piece can be completely removed from the case. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The front face of the radio that faces out of the case when opened, is white-flecked green in colour with a series of 6 black knobs protruding from its surface. Also protruding from the radio are a blue, plug-like hexagonal shape with 7 prongs coming out of it. There is also a white metre-like object near the bottom-centre of the radio, a metal dial in the top right corner, and a snap in the top left corner that snaps into a leather piece attached just left of the centre of the case's inner hinge. The middle and top centre of the radio is occupied by what looks like a speaker. When the radio is taken out of the case, one can see that it consists of a metal skeleton with its inner-workings soldered together (no circuit-board) and completely open to the viewer's eye (no casing).</p>

<p>The model T1 Dual Timer (2016.zoo.2.3) is a light grey metal cube with a dial on one of its faces. The cube also has a black rubber cord that is attached to its posterior that culminates in a plug-like metal connector, inside which are 2 larger prongs surrounded by 7 smaller prongs. The ""connector"" has an movable metal circular part around it and is embossed with the word ""AMPHENOL"" once on both the movable and stable parts. The dial on the front of the object is surrounded by a rounded square metal plaque. On the plaque, ""nuclear-chicago"" is labeled in the top right corner, and ""DUAL TIMER"" is labeled under the centre of the dial. From the centre of the dial outward, there are four different series of numbers that circle its periphery. The series closest to the dial comprises red numbers that count from 0-55 in increments of 5. The second series is printed in black and counts from 55 to 5 in increments of 5. The next series, located outside the movable part of the dial, is printed in black and counts from .10 to .90 in increments of 10 and the outermost number series is printed in red and counts from .90 to .10 in increments of 10. There is an on/off switch on the bottom right corner of the plaque. The dial only moves one full rotation to the right and one full rotation to the left.</p>

The counting planchets were used to weigh biological samples that had been exposed to radiation.

The T1 dual timer was used with a scaler unit (machine that counts the effects of radiation over a time period), to count radioisotopes (unstable atoms that emit nuclear energy). The timer would be set to begin counting at a predetermined time and this would also trigger the scaler unit to begin counting radioisotopes.

"Visual Occlusion Instrument","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The instrument consists of two components: a Head Assembly which is connected by a long electrical wire to a main Control Unit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Head Assembly is a flexible visor of wood laminate with an ?aluminum frontispiece. It has two rectangular eye slots with two wooden shutters painted black. Four small metal bolts control the movement of the shutters. The visor is rounded at the temple and each arm has a space that is most likely intended to accommodate a bolt or other fastener for a helmet or similar apparatus. Electrical wiring behind the frontispiece and above the eye slots collects in a long electrical wire that extends from the arm of the left eye slot to the main Control Unit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Control Unit is a large metal box. It is unpainted and grey in colour. The box consists of a front panel with controls, a hinged top panel with vents, and a back panel with vents and a wide slat at its base for wiring. The sides of the box each have a handle of the same metal. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The front panel has been attached to the box with metal screws and projects forward from rest of the box. The square hole to which it was bolted does not share its dimensions suggesting that the front panel was not made to fit.<br />
The bottom left corner of the front panel has three features (from left to right): a red indicator light, an “on/off” toggle switch, and a knob marked “Fuse” with an arrow indicating a counter-clockwise direction. An attached plaque in the upper centre bears a manufacturer’s name and is etched with the instrument’s name and an order number. The right side of the front panel has two slide switches and eight rotating dials. These are separated roughly into three rows and three columns: a column under the label “Left” corresponding to the left-eye shutter on the Head Assembly, a ‘shared’ column, then a “Right” column corresponding to the right shutter.<br />
The two switches centred at the top can move to the “Off”, “Run”, or “On” positions. On each side of this switch is a dial labelled “On Off Ratio” with settings numbered clockwise from 1-10 on a black, circular face. In the centre of the row below, there is a dial labelled “Phase” and on each side is a dial labelled “Frequency”. All 3 dials in this row have metallic, square faces with settings numbering clockwise from 1-10. Below, the dial at the centre of the row switches from “Sync.” on the left to “Ind.” on the right. On each side is a dial labelled “Freq. Range” which moves from settings numbered 1-3 clockwise. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The slatted top panel lifts on hinges. Inside the metal box has an ?electrical board at its bottom. The board holds five (?ten) transformers, five capacitors, and fifteen vacuum tubes, all of varying sizes and makes. Manufacturers include: Hammond Manufacturing LTD. for transformers, Mallory for capacitors, and Raytheon, Marconi, GE, and Westinghouse for vacuum tubes.<br />
Typewritten labels were pasted on the electrical board beside most vacuum tube places indicating the voltage and model required (e.g. “V8 2D21” next to a Marconi vacuum tube).<br />
The back of the board sports two electrical wires through the slat in the back panel of the box. The wire closest to the left connects to the Head Assembly, while the central wire ends in a black, three-pronged, North American wall plug.</p>

The dials and switches on the Control Unit determine the frequency at which the eye shutters on the Head Assembly cover the eye slots. They can also determine whether both shutters will fall at the same time or whether the experimenter will control each shutter independently.
The instrument was most likely used in connection with professor John W. Senders’ research concerning visual sampling and the reception of tachistoscopic information. Senders’ relevant research frequently focused on the visual perception of pilots and automobile drivers. In this video clip, Senders conducts an “experiment on the attention span needed for safe driving” with a visual occlusion device: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOguslSPpqo 

Unlike the device in the clip, the Visual Occlusion Instrument has a wall plug suggesting that it was intended for indoor use. It also has controls for eye shutters that move independently from one another. Despite these differences, the device in the video may indicate that the Visual Occlusion Instrument was similarly used by an experimenter to test a subject’s ability to process visual information through brief exposure.","As described in the “Condition Report”, the instrument is in poor condition. The rubber coating on the two main electrical wires is brittle and already cracked in places. The wire connecting to the Head Assembly has begun to fray leaving the wires exposed. 

The electrical board is covered in thick dust and other small particles and it is scattered with mouse droppings. 

Further damage is primarily cosmetic: 
The previous repairs to the left “Off/Run/On” switch have left green tape visible and the switch is still loose; a piece has broken off of the right “Freq. Range” dial; there is residue from masking tape in the centre of the front panel; the top panel is dented in the centre; there are a few minor scuffs and scratches primarily on the front panel and right side of the Control Unit box; and there are chips and scratches on the shutters of the Head Assembly (one large chip on the right eye shutter).",?Helmet,"?George Kelk LTD. It may be that this manufacturer only made the Control Unit’s front panel with switches and the internal electrical board, but that the metal box to which it was bolted was manufactured elsewhere.",?1953-8,"Prof. Paul Milgram, Engineering Psychology, U of T.",,"The instrument’s accompanying folder includes a packing slip dated 1958, as well as a full circuit diagram, graphs plotting shutter frequency, etc. The initial typewritten pages indicate how the machine works, but not what it was used for.

General research using the search terms “visual occlusion instrument” produced minimal results. The search “visual occlusion device” provided a link to the “PLATO Visual Occlusion Spectacles” from Translucent Technologies Inc. The spectacles are intended for researching tachistoscopic perceptions by allowing “an experimenter accurately to control the timing of presentation of visual information to an experimental subject”.
http://www.translucent.ca/plato.html

The search terms “visual occlusion instrument”, “visual occlusion device”, “visual occlusion”, “eye shutter” and “light shutter” produced no relevant results in the databases and trade catalogues listed in the Appendices of the UTSIC Instruction Manual. 
Similarly, searches for “George Kelk LTD” produced no results in Makers Databases. The website for what is now KELK states that the company has been manufacturing “state-of-the-art electronic measurement equipment” since its establishment in 1953. http://www.kelk.com/ 

All subsequent research centered on a suggestion that the instrument may have been used in connection to the work of John W. Senders, Professor Emeritus of Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. (Note: it was also mentioned that Senders did not recall using this exact instrument). The “CV” section on Senders’ website lists “Papers, Reports and Publications” and provides links to selected articles. These works from the list were consulted:

"Kirschmann Coaxial Colour Wheel","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sturdy wooden box contains a rectangular steel instrument, a broken glass wheel, seven metal wheels, four square wooden spacers, two loops of cord, an additional length of cord, and several smaller loose parts (screws, nuts, and cardboard washers).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The instrument is a black anodized steel rectangle 25 cm x 10.4 cm. Its longer sides are bordered by walls of the same material which are 1.5 cm tall. The surface of the instrument features two rotating axles located towards opposite sides of the instrument, arranged on the centre line of the instrument's face. The right axle supports two concentric circular pulleys of 5.8 cm in outside diameter. These may be spun using a handle attached to the topmost pulley. The left axle is set in a circular cut-out in the instruments face. This is a vertical spindle with a threaded inner hollow onto which may be placed a machined pulley/ spindle of approximately 1.5 cm in outside diameter. The glass coloured disc would have been placed on this pulley/ spindle in such a way that the pulley/  spindle and glass wheel would have been spun by the lowermost of the pulleys on the right axle using  a loop of cord. One of the steel disks would have been mounted above the glass disc on the pulley spindle. The integrated pulley on the steel disk would have been attached to the upper pulley on the right axle by a second loop of cord. The two wheels mounted on the pulley/ spindle  were secured by a screw in the threaded hole inside the vertical spindle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The glass wheel (now shattered) originally consisted of two glass plates approximately 9.5 cm in outside diameter. Between these plates are sandwiched segments of transparent coloured gelatin sheet in such a way that they cover the entire inside surface of the glass plates. Each piece tapers from the edge to a central hole in such a way that it forms a pie segment and is about 4 mm on its outside edge, 1 mm on its inside edge. The pieces form a pattern of eight coloured segments that repeats five times over the surface of the wheel.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The seven metal wheels each contain cut out patters intended to mask a portion of the coloured wheel beneath it. Six of these are anodized black and have an integrated pulley soldered to the centre of its bottom surface. The seventh is of uncoated brass and appears to have been locally made given the marks scribed on its surface. It does not have a pulley. The black wheels are 8.8 cm in outside diameter. The brass wheel is 10 cm in outside diameter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The square wooden spacers are used to separate and secure the metal wheels when stored in a compartment in the wooden case. Each has a hole in its centre to accommodate the pulley of the metal wheels. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loops of cord are meant to connect the pulleys on either side to each other in such a way that by turning the concentric pulleys on the right side using the attached handle, the wheels on the left are set spinning.</p>

The two concentric pulleys rotated a coloured wheel, and a metal disc anchored above it at nearly the same rate. Parts of the transparent coloured disc were visible through cutouts in the metal mask. Because both were rotating rapidly, the component colours visible on the wheel and the black metal disk combined to produce a homogeneous blend of colour. Because the disk and the mask rotated at different rates, the portion of the coloured disk visible through the cutout in the metal disc changed with time. The effect was a shifting blend of colour.

<p>The object consists of a large flat wooden base on which rests ten tuning fork and resonator units connected to a ten-key keyboard. The keyboard has ten ivory plated wooden keys each attached to a string that leads to one of the ten resonator units. Pressing a key causes the string to be pulled, releasing the covering over the resonator opening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each resonator unit consists of a flat wooden base of its own holding a steel tuning fork, a brass cylindrical resonator held by a brass stand (the largest resonator is held by two brass stands) on an adjustable wooden base attached to the unit base. A black coated metal paddle covers the opening to the resonator, held in place by a steel spring that causes it to return to its original position covering the resonator opening once the key holding its attached string is released. On either side of the tuning fork are two vertical black-coated metal bars each holding a coil of copper wire with an extended steel piece extending to the bars of the tuning fork. When current is run through the coils, the tuning fork vibrates. These proximity of these black metal bars (and attendant coils and steel pieces) can be adjusted at the base via brass knobs. At the base are two contact points holding the copper wire that runs into the coils.</p>

The initial instruments used a combination of electrically driven tuning forks, resonators and piano keys to synthesise compound sounds. When the system was on, all of the forks would vibrate in series. To activate a sound, however, one needed to press an ivory piano which moved a circular lid away from the opening of the resonators thus activating the sound.

"Biometrics Model 200 Eye Movement Monitor","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three pieces together: the monitor and its glasses, and two instructions manuals.<br />
The monitor is a metal box that has the controls for the system. On its front are a number of plastic knobs and metal switches that allow the researcher to change settings for the printing of data and for what they want to monitor using the glasses. There are switches to turn the machine on and off and to turn the photodiodes in the glasses on and off. There is a power cord attached at the back of the monitor for charging the battery contained within the monitor. There is also a cord that attaches to the right side of the glasses the participant wears. The glasses are made to sit on the participant's nose and ears and there is a strip of stretchy elastic material that spans from one glasses stem to the other. Attached at the front of each side of the glasses is a metal bar attached by a piece of plastic to the frame. These metal bars hold the small photodiodes, which are centered in the front of each eye. This is the most important piece that actually monitors where the eye is moving and relays the information back to the monitor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first instructions manual contains information about the monitor and how to use it. It explains how to hook up the various parts of the monitor and how to change the settings to obtain different information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second monitor contains more of the technical specifications of the monitor. It contains circuits and other information that might assist more if the monitor were to be taken apart.</p>

"Lab Animal Feeder","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The portion of the apparatus, deemed the “front”, consists of two pieces of flat metal that have been attached. These plates will be referred to as the “front left plate” and the “front right plate.” The “front left plate” is mostly covered by a large metal gear with small teeth on the outside and small holes that form a circle around the inside edge of the gear. In the middle of the gear, there is a round knob with a black plastic head that is screwed on to the gear. A label has been attached to the knob with a string, which reads “BISHOP.” On the part of the knob that has been screwed to the gear someone has written the word “LEFT” in red. On the top right corner of the “front left plate” a University of Toronto label has been screwed down. On the bottom left of the “front left plate” a manufacturing label has been screwed to it.  To the right of this label are four more screws and a much smaller corroded metal gear that fits into the larger gear. This small gear is attached to a rectangular piece of metal that protrudes outward. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The “front right plate” is similar but is missing the large gear. However, there are machine made holes and scratch marks that indicate that a similar gear was once attached to it. This side also has a manufacturing label screwed to the bottom left corner and a smaller gear on the right corner with a rectangular piece of metal that protrudes outward. The other main difference is that this side has 7 discolored screws.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The portion of the apparatus, deemed the “back”, will again be referred to in terms of the “back left plate” and the “back right plate.” On the top of “back left plate” there is a protruding metal rectangle. This rectangle has three holes in it. The largest hole is open, and inside is a small light bulb. On either side of this hole, there are two smaller holes, which connect to plastic tubing. These tubes connect to a small rectangle screwed into the plate on each side. From the light bulb section four wires protrude. The largest two are black, and the two smaller ones are green and white. Each black wire connects to two brown plastic pieces with a label reading “USE ASTATIC NEEDLE N4-3” on each. The green and white wires connect to the light. These wires then connect to a small black box on the left side of the apparatus. From this box run two black wires and two purple wires. These wires connect to rounded rectangular protruding boxes on the bottom left of each plate. One black and purple wire connects to the left side of each box. Additionally, each plate has a rounded cylinder protruding from its center, which has been screwed in where the knob is located on the front. Below these cylinders is a metal bar that is most likely holding the two plates together.  There are two small holes located on the bottom edge of each plate that have residue around them as if they were both once connected to something else. The right edge of the “back right plate” has a long metal rod protruding from its center.</p>

He soon went into business for himself and founded the Ralph Gerbrands Company, which became a major supplier of experimental psychology equipment, mostly used for operant conditioning. He expanded his business in 1940, when he set up a shop in his home and began publishing a catalogue.  About 1954, he began working in a rented shop space on Warren Street and later moved to a plant on Beck Road in 1967.  His most well known product is the cumulative recorder. He advertised his products in the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior for 37 years from the time the journal started in 1958 until 1994. Gerbrands retired in 1973.

"Model of Hermann von Helmholtz's Theory of Hearing","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This instrument consists of a metal frame supported by a wooden base. Within the frame is a vertical pendulum. This consists of a steel rod and a weight. The pendulum swings along one axis, perpendicular to the frame’s orientation. The length of the pendulum can be adjusted by moving the weight along the length of a steel bar and securing it with set screw. The pendulum is suspended within the steel frame from a pivot that runs inside the frame parallel to the top. To the right of the pendulum, suspended from its bearing-mounted pivot, is a row of six small metal weights. These are suspended from strings of regularly increasing length such that they appear in a diagonally descending row.  When the pendulum is set in motion, these weights will swing from the pivot in the same orientation as the pendulum.</p>

Robarts Research Library at the University of Toronto. As a result of the piqued interest in the historical significant scientific and technological objects around the University of Toronto campus, President John Robert Evans granted the Institute the funds to conduct an inventory of “all objects and materials relating to research and teaching of science and engineering at the University of Toronto.” Over the next three years the survey was performed by several graduate students including Joy Smith and Sandra Morton, who were enrolled in the joint University of Toronto/ Royal Ontario Museum Museology Program. According to Dr. Bruce Sinclair, Director of the Institute, “the University has an important history of scientific and technical accomplishments”, as such this was “the first step toward a greater recognition of that history.”  In 1978, President Evans appointed a committee, with Dr. Bruce Sinclair as chair, to supervise the project.

"Wheel Instrument for Vernier Acuity Measurement","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This device is an articulating wheel instrument comprised mainly of iron that has been painted black. A triangular piece of iron is vertically mounted on a horizontal rectangular iron base. The vertical wheel is attached to the triangular stand by a horizontal steel rod. The flat horizontal base, vertical triangular piece, and vertical circular wheel are made of iron that has been painted black.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The wheel has six rectangular openings in it where glass slides would have been inserted. Plastic knobs directly adjacent to all four sides of each opening would have held the slides in place. These knobs are on the side of the wheel opposite the vertical triangular stand. Visible screws on the side of the wheel directly opposite the knobs hold the knobs onto the wheel. Grey pieces of paper are taped adjacent to and slightly covering each of the rectangular openings on the side of the wheel facing the vertical stand. Two of these pieces of paper are torn. Between each rectangular openings, there is a small curved indent in the edge of the wheel. There is a a small metal plate screwed onto the wheel directly adjacent to each indent. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>White sticky notes and pieces of yellow masking tape are adhered to the side of the wheel opposite the side that faces the vertical stand. There is one sticky note (or piece of a sticky note) and one piece of masking tape directly adjacent to each rectangular opening, all on the side of the opening closest to the centre of the wheel. The pieces of tape appear to number the slide openings from one to six. The sticky notes are inscribed with letters and numbers corresponding to labels on certain glass slides that accompany the instrument.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An electrical control box is attached to the side of the vertical stand opposite the wheel. The exterior of the box is aluminum with a black panel facing away from the instrument. This panel has a black knob in the centre with the numbers 0 to 100 around it in increments of 10. The electrical box indicates its maker: “CRAMER CONTROLS”. The box also includes the words “TYPE”, “SERIAL”, “POLES”, “MOTOR VOLTS-CY”, “SWITCH”, “SET”, “w.d.” and “RELAY VOLTS-CY”, each with a spot for user inscription based on these categories, but these spots have not been inscribed upon. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three wires are attached to the bottom of the electrical control box. One is attached to the control box and a metal cylinder adjacent to the box on the side of the box opposite the black knob. Another wire connects the box to a two prong plug. Another wire connects the control box to a speckled metal box which has one large round red button. This speckled box is not attached to the instrument in any other way apart from the wire connecting it to the control box. Another wire is amongst the others, but is not attached to the control box. It is an extension cord with a two-pronged female end and a three-pronged grounded male end, which was presumably used to extend the distance from a plug at which the instrument could be operated. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The steel rod which attaches the wheel to the vertical stand extends through the wheel to a vertical square metal plate on the side of the wheel opposite the stand. This square metal plate is screwed to a vertical aluminum plate below it, which is attached to and directly above a large white vertical rectangular plastic piece. Where the plastic is attached to the metal by two screws, there is an additional empty screw hole, as well as scratches on the aluminium in a half circle pattern, suggesting that a missing part of the instrument at one time scraped against this spot regularly. The large rectangular plastic piece has a glossy finish, is smooth to the touch, and is partially translucent to light. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the bottom left of the triangular vertical stand, when facing the instrument from the side opposite the wheel, there is a small lever with a spring that connects to a rod on the opposite side of the base. When this lever is pressed, the rod on the side of the base adjacent to the wheel raises and a small round stopper on the end of the rod moves into a position where it could fit into the round indents around the edges of the wheel. If the wheel was in a certain position this rod would hold the wheel in place so that it could not spin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As well as the wheel instrument, this device came to UTSIC with a wooden box of glass slides. The box currently holds 38 slides and has 2 empty slots, for a capacity of 40 glass slides. This set should be catalogued as 2014.ep.7.2.</p>

The subject sits at a set distance from the wheel and views one of the glass plates at a time. The presentation of the glass slides is controlled by the wheel rotating and presenting the subject with one plate at a time based on a predetermined presentation formula. Each glass plate has a set of lines on it. The subject’s task is to say whether or not the lines on various slides are offset or exactly lined up. This test is analogous to what would be done by someone reading a vernier scale. The analysis of the data resulting from this test is done using standard techniques of psychophysics. 

The information about the function of this instrument was provided by Professor Paul Milgram at Engineering Psychology in the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering.","Overall, the instrument is in fair condition, but not in an operable state. 

The black paint is worn off near the outer edges of the wheel and around the large rectangular holes in the wheel. The areas with worn paint appear almost exclusively on the side of the wheel which faces the electrical control box. The areas where the paint is worn reveal a metallic surface underneath. 

Two of the pieces of paper which are taped partially over the rectangular holes in the wheel are torn.

The plastic outer layer on the wire which connects the control box to the two-pronged plug is cracked and worn off at numerous points along the wire. 

One of the prongs on the three-pronged extension cord plug is bent.

There is evidence of a missing part on the vertical rectangular aluminum piece that is attached to and directly above the large white rectangular plastic piece. Where the plastic is attached to the metal by two screws, there is an additional empty screw hole, as well as scratches on the aluminium in a half circle pattern, suggesting that another part of the instrument scraped against this spot numerous times. 

Dust has settled on most surface areas of the instrument.

The object should be cleaned off to remove dust. The 3 wires should be untangled and moved out of their current location, which is through one of the rectangular holes in the wheel, so that the wheel can be turned if desired.
There are many layers of tape and sticky notes on the wheel, which could be removed if desired. Most of these items are attached to the side of the wheel opposite the vertical stand and control box.

It is necessary that two individuals cooperate to pick up or move the instrument because of its size and weight.

"Metal Mazes","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two very similar objects. They consist of a square, unpainted wooden base and thin strips of metal set vertically on the base. The strips have been shaped to form the railings of a circular maze with six strata. At the center of the mazes, the sixth stratum, a circular hole has been carved through the base.<br />
The metal railings of the mazes have been welded to smaller strips of the same material, height, and width, to form the ‘dead ends’ of the mazes. As a result, each maze exists as a single structural component. This is securely attached to the base by means of nails welded to the metal at the dead end corners. The nails have been affixed into the base so that the maze may not be rotated or removed from the base without damage to the object.<br />
On the front right corner of the base of one of the mazes facing horizontally there is evidence of a previous label with a small amount of remaining adhesive. The metal aspect has been painted with beige and black alternating sections.</p>

Watson’s maze was first used by Helen Hubbert to test “the difference in the acquisition of habits of animals of different ages” (Watson 1914a, 58). 
However, the dimensions of the maze currently in the care of UTSIC do not match those detailed by Watson; this maze is far too small and thus may not be conclusively identified with Watson’s circular maze. 
In an e-mail correspondence from February 26, 2014, it was suggested by Dr. Hank Stam at the University of Calgary that the maze may be a prototype or model of Watson's circular maze ""for teaching purposes,"" or an adaptation of Watson's maze to test smaller species. Dr. Christopher Green at York University similarly provided that the maze may have been used for insect testing (e-mail February 22, 2014). However, it was articulated in both cases that these possibilities are purely speculative.

"Recording Carriage","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This device consists of an aperture of horizontal metal bars set on two  pillars attached to a metal base. Two of these metal bars form a support structure, and between them is a round grooved rod with a round plate attached at either end. The smaller of these plates has jagged metal teeth, and the larger is marked with a numerical scale around the edge. Each number corresponds to a slit in the plate, and a metal blade fits into these slits to steady the grooved rod. This blade is clamped with a brass knob, and there are similar knobs at either end of the grooved rod on the metal aperture.<br />
Also on this aperture, resting on the horizontal bars, is a metal fixture to which is attached a blade pointer, which points to a horizontal scale affixed to the base of the aperture. To the top of one of the pillars is affixed a large dial, marked to measure up to ten litres. On the face of this dial are four smaller dials each marked to measure litres and cubic metres in different increments. There is a dial on on end of the metal base that adjusts how the instrument is propped up; at the other end are four bolts, two completely screwed in and two partially screwed in.</p>

<p>The first piece, 2009.ph.272.1, consists of a metal tube coated in canvas and painted dark green. This cylinder is closed at both ends with what appear to be caps that are ringed by suede cushions. In one side of each cap there is a round glass window framed with black plastic. A leather strap is affixed to each of these caps, though both straps are broken and worn. Leather straps are also fixed around the base of each cap and fixed closed with orange-painted rivets, though these are also broken. In the centre of the tube is an adjustable eyepiece marked with a numerical scale around its outside ring, and beneath it is a fragment of a leather strap riveted to the tube body. To one side is a small glass window that shows a marked scale, and on this same side is a textured adjusting dial. On the other side of the tube is a metal screwed-on cap, which opens to reveal three small holes. The whole piece is set on two wooden supports 2009.ph.272.2 and 2009.ph.272.3. Each support has a semicircular cutout in which an end of the tube may rest, padded with felt. A paper label is affixed to the base of one of these supports.</p>

The double siren was one of Koenig’s more popular instruments. It consisted of two “polyphonic” or “multivoiced” sirens with more than one series of holes, and was an invention of the German physicist and former teacher of Hermann von Helmholtz, Heinrich Wilhelm Dove (1803–1879). It produced several pure tones simultaneously, in musical chords, and under greater pressure. It was ideal for demonstrating interference effects (when sound waves combined to amplify or diminish each other) and combination tones).

"Leepvideo System","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2013.ep.2 a: Link junction box<br />
The Leepvideo link junction box consists of a metallic box with a slanted face. The face includes two sets of eight input sockets, labelled ""L"" and ""R"" respectively. These correspond to the left and right eyes of the remote camera system (puppet) and virtual reality helmet (cyberface). The panel on the left side includes input sockets for the puppet. Two sockets correspond to cables coming from the left and right ""eyes"" of the puppet. The left side panel includes two additional sockets for cables of the puppet, potentially for audio data. The right side panel includes output sockets for the cyberface helmet, and an on/off switch for the link junction box. Two sockets correspond to the left and right eyes of the cyberface system, and are labelled ""L"" and ""R"" accordingly. An additional socket provides an outlet for an audio cable from the cyberface system. The back panel includes an electrical cable for plugging the instrument into a power source.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2013.ep.2 b: Remote camera system (puppet)<br />
The Puppet consists of a metallic base and wooden panels cut to represent the profile of a human head, with cameras set behind glass in each ""eye."" The metallic base consists of three metallic legs with rubber bases. The wooden head is mounted onto the metallic base with screws, and positioned upright. Each side of the flat wooden profile of the head includes an ""eye"" consisting of a camera positioned within a cylinder, protected by glass. Each side also includes a small hole (1 cm in diameter) representing the ""ear"" of the puppet. These holes each contain a microphone for collecting auditory information for for the puppet. The back of the puppet head includes two output cables for the information from the right and left sides of the puppet. These cables are gathered together with electrical tape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2013.ep.02 c: Cyberface head-mounted display<br />
The head-mounted display consists of the original manufacturer's display apparatus, repurposed by the user, who attached the visual display to a helmet using steel bars. The plastic round helmet includes an inside fabric lining with headphones sewn into the lining. The helmet includes a chin strap for strapping the apparatus to the user's head. Two steel bars are glued to the sides of the helmet, which are attached by a horizontal bar in front of the helmet. These bars provide a mounting structure for the visual display apparatus, which consists of a plastic box with two circular screens positioned for both eyes of the user wearing the helmet. Input cables are attached to the visual display apparatus, to relay visual information from the puppet (via link junction box). The steel bars extend beyond the back of the helmet, and include weights attached to the ends of the bars. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2013.ep.02 d: Head strap<br />
The head strap for the Leepvideo system consists of a metal band that crosses the forehead of the user, attached to plastic panels on each side. These plastic panels surround the sides of the head. Attached to each of the plastic panels are three fabric straps with velcro patches on the ends. These allow the user to attach the straps from either side so that the head strap is securely fastened to the head. In the original configuration of the instrument, this head strap would have been attached to the Cyberface head-mounted display using screws. However, the user repurposed the instrument by attaching it to a helmet.</p>

This work is what first made wide angle telepresence possible. With the release of the original LEEP Cyberface In March of 1989, Eric Howlett became the first to offer a commercial head-mounted display. The technology is essentially identical to that in the NASA ""VIEWS"" (Virtual Interface Environment Work Station). Like the NASA HMD, the Cyberface is monochromatic, but provides very wide angle stereo.

Affixed perpendicularly to the interior side of the lid there is a tube of metal, with an adjustable knob on one side. On one side of this tube, lying flat against the tube, is a small, rectangular flat piece of metal, like a reed.<br /><br />For a section of its longer faces, the box is cut open on three sides and a three-sided glass window covers this open hole. This has black tape connecting the sheets at their right angles and where the glass connects to the wood. The metal tube and its affixed reed is visible through this window when the end of the box is attached. On the other end of the wooden box from the metal tube there is wooden tube; this can be removed.</p>

"Unidentified Glass Apparatus","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A piece of glass consisting of various tubes and bulbs. At one end, there is a roughly cylindrical bulb connected on its side by a short tube to a a bulbous glass funnel, open on one end.  The cylindrical bulb contains a spear of glass extending through its centre. Emerging from the end of the cylindrical bulb is another tube which is attached to it. This tube is is curved and connects to a glass tube outlet, about 5.5cm long and rectangular in cross-section, so it is quite flat. Emerging at a 90 degree angle from the beginning of this rectangular tube is another length of round tube which is open at one end. At the other end of the rectangular tube another longer length of round tube emerges, turns in a u-curve, and extends in the same direction as the shorter length of tube. This too is open at the end. Both ends of the tube are not smoothly cut, as if they have been severed while hot.</p>

Electroscope,"This is a metal instrument with a box shaped body standing on a circular base. The base consists of a round disk with three outcropping sections through which three large screws are fitted vertically. These form the feet of the instrument. The body of the instrument is rectangular, square at the base and top and taller than it is wide. On one face there is a circular opening covered with a glass panel; this has a screw attachment around it, but nothing is attached. On the opposite face there is a tube emerging horizontally from the box. This is connected to a sliding panel that can be adjusted left or right a short distance by turning a screw with a knurled knob end. On the two other faces there are two large electrical posts, with insulated bases and knobs fitted. Smaller electrical posts sit connected to the base of the larger posts.

The box is covered by a square lid held in place by three small screws with large round ends. Sitting on top of this lid, and supported above it by two pillars and a screw apparatus there is a cylindrical dish-shaped component. Inside and central in the base of this dish there is a flat disk. This is connected through to the box by a long screw hanging vertically down through the centre of the box. This has a short length of fine wire attached to it. 

Suspended in the centre of the box are a pair of metal rods fixed to the base of the box. These are separated by about half a centimeter and connected by rods to the electrical posts on the side of the box; the gap between these two is visible through the adjustable tube. An additional length of very fine wire is coiled next to this. Laying on the floor of the interior of the box there is a small rectangular mirror.

"Dale Telescope","This is a large telescope contained in a long rectangular wooden box. The box has a metal plaque in the centre of its lid, and heavy ornamental handles at either end. There are two rotating latches and loops to hold the box closed, and a small keyhole at the front of the box. The lid is hinged along the back. 

The telescope is cylindrical and sits in the box on green felt-covered wooden blocks. More wooden blocks are affixed to the top of the box to hold the telescope in place when the lid is closed.  Other wooden blocks with round holes and a metal bracket are provided to support components; these are mostly empty of components. Also in the box, there is a long rod with a round knob at one end and a hinged portion at the other, two cylindrical disk pieces screwed onto upright screws fixed into the box and a round cardboard disk with a round hole cut in the centre.

At the objective end of the telescope, the tube widens slightly. There is a cylindrical metal lens cover with slits cut in the metal so it can fit snugly over the opening. Inside the opening, the interior of the telescope is threaded. 

At the other end, there is a small sighting telescope (a finderscope) affixed alongside the main telescope. The main telescope has an attachment that narrows the tube. There is a cylindrical metal piece screwed into this end. There does not appear to be a lens at either end of the telescope; however, there may be a low-power lens in the centre. Near this end, emerging from the tube of the telescope there is a circular knob similar to the ones contained in the box. 

About halfway along the telescope tube, there are two screws emerging perpendicularly. One of these has a nut screwed around its base. Towards the eyepiece end, there is an opening in the cylindrical body of the tube with a rod visible underneath. This appears to be shorn or broken off below the level of the exterior tube.

Underneath the telescope inside the box, there was a letter in the box addressed to Donald McCrae at the David Dunlap Observatory from W. (Bill) Weller at York University's Centre for Research in Experimental Space Science, dated 1973. This letter is now in the object's file. There was a moving label resting on the top of the box; this has now been placed inside the box.

Sextant,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a sextant with four telescope/optical attachments in a fan shaped wooden box. The box is hinged on one of the sides. The sextant is stored flat in the box, with the handle facing downwards, and the additional components stored underneath. A block of wood affixed to the lid holds the sextant in place when the lid is closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sextant is made of brass, painted black with a wooden handle underneath it. It is triangular, with an unpainted graduated arc on one side (the lower side when in use). There is a mirror, ring mount for telescope attachments, and filters above, on the straight sides. The ring mount has an adjusting brass knob and grooves for telescope attachments. The mirror is adjacent to the ring mount, faces away from ring mount (if the sextant is held in the right hand) and is slightly cracked. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adjacent to the mirror are four coloured glass filters for reflected light from the mirror. Adjacent to the filters is mounted an oval glass piece, split in two. One half is a mirror angled to reflect light from the primary mirror to the ring mount. The other half is clear to allow direct observation through a telescope attachment on the ring mount. Adjacent to the split oval lens are 3 more coloured glass filters for direct light from a distant observation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The graduated arc covers roughly 60 degrees and is labeled from 5 to 0 to 145. Finely inscribed increments between these numbers may be read using a magnifying glass attached to the measuring arm of the sextant. The measuring arm moves along the graduated arc as the top mirror is adjusted and has a movable Vernier marked from 0 to 10. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three of the telescope attachments are threaded to fit into the ring mount; the fourth is a loose component lens. The telescope attachments vary in length and lens aperture.</p>

"Equinoctial Ring Sundial","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a instrument consisting of vertical rings mounted on a circular base. The base stands on a tripod of decorated feet, each of which has an adjustable screw knob through the centre which allows the instrument to be leveled. The circular base has a central circular window revealing a compass set in the base. This has a large central needle, a compass rose engraved on the base of the compass and is graduated on two levels around the rim with degrees--the top level sits at the level of the rotating needle. Set in the base of this there are two bubble levels filled with clear liquid arranged at right angles to one another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around the rim of the compass, engraved on the circular base, there are a series of circular scales. The innermost of these is divided into large sections labelled with months, the second divides each of these sections into 30 degrees, the third is divided non-linearly with numbers between 0 and 16. The fourth consists of large sections labelled ""WATCH"" ""FASTER"" ""WATCH"" ""LOWER"". The fifth divides the circle into degrees labelled in quarters of a circle between 0 and 90°. Outside of there is a short and decorated length of scale with four graduations labelled in 15s. Affixed vertically to the base there is a small metal loop on a short vertical stand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oriented vertically and supported by an ornate floral stand on top of this base is a metal ring. In the centre of this there is a smaller ring that first inside the larger one. This is hinged at two points allowing it to pivot from alignment with the outer ring to being perpendicular with it. Metal brackets affixed to the external print prevent it from rotating further than this. On one side of the outer ring, there is a scale graduated in degrees, labelled in quarters of a circle. The inner rim on this side is divided into 24 sections, and labelled in semi-circles with roman numerals between I and XII. At the top and bottom of the ring, outside of the scale on the outer ring, there are small sections of Vernier. On the other side, both the inner and outer rings are engraved with the names of cities and their respective latitudes, for example: ""Lisbon Lat 38°45'"". At the base of this side there is a knob emerging perpendicularly from the metal ring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Running diagonally through the centre of the outer disk there is a metal plate with a rectangular cut-out in the centre. This is held in place at either end by metal pins that fit into brackets to the outer disk that allow the metal piece to rotate. On one side, the plate is engraved with a pair of non-linear scales, one above the other, and the names of months. On the other side, the top of the plate is engraved with two scales, again one atop the other, and at the top the letters ""SD Æ ND"" and along the base the symbols of the Greek zodiac. These symbols also appear on the lower scales.</p>

"Camera, ICA Icarette Model D","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This object is a leather case with lock and strap containing a flat, wide camera case and a key in zip lock bag (stored at the base of the case). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An opening on back of the camera, opened by simultaneously depressing two silver latches, allows film to be loaded on a pair of wooden rollers. The back also features a small “autographic” window to inscribe information directly on the film. When a small raised bump on the side of the case is depressed, the front opens to allow the lens, with black concertina skirt, to come forward approx. 20cm. Around the circumference of the lens increments from 4.5 to 32 are marked. The lens front has two circular dials, one marked “T, B, I” and other with five-pointed star and arrow with “1,2,5,10, 25,50,100,150” on circumference. A shutter release button on a short cable is attached to the lens mount. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lens comes forward to an “infinity” focus position, and can be adjusted from there. On the side along the track for lens, there is a  bone or ivory plaque marked “Feet” with the increments: “6, 10, 13, 20, 25, 40, INF.” The camera has a collapsible viewfinder with metal mirror located immediately to the left of the main lens. Adjacent to the view finder is a miniature level. A wire frame folds out from lens to right of camera and metal view finder on top of camera pops up to allow viewing through frame. There is a tripod mount screw at the bottom of the camera.</p>

On the lower right corner there is a knob to move a lever which allows the timepiece to rotate in both directions (such that if the chronometer moves the face of the timepiece always remains pointed upwards), or fix it in place. On the top right there is a winding key set upright in a wooden support. The timepiece has a metallic clock face (I-XII) with minute and hour hands and a smaller face (0-60) with a second hand. There is also a dial marked from 0 to 56 (in increments of 8), labeled “Wind”.</p>

These are graduated in inches, one side subdivided into 1/8"" and the other in to 1/10"". Along the length of the ruler is a long rod with two ridged wheels at each end; this rod is covered with a wooden cover with a small metal knob in the middle. This was once glued in place but has now separated from the ruler. The wheels protrude through the ruler, and permit it to be rolled in one direction only.</p>

""Charles Hearn was born in Exeter, England but is recorded as working in Toronto, Canada starting in 1857. He moved to Montreal around 1860-61, where he opened shop as an ""optician and mathematical instrument-maker."" His surveying instruments had a unique design that combined his own ideas with American and British features. After his death in 1865, his wife Susan Watson Hearn took over running the company. Shortly after this she married another instrument maker called Thomas Harrison, and the company became Hearn &amp;amp; Harrison. Like many instrument makers at this time they did business with the government. After 1900 none of the original family was involved in running the company, which continued to operate until 1936.""",,https://utsic.mikethicke.com/wpm_instrument/engineers-slide-rule/,publish

"Bird behaviour recorder","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bird behaviour recorder is perhaps better termed a keyboard than a recorder as such. It served as a means of inputting data into other electronic devices that did the actual “recording,” such as a bank of counters or an Esterline-Angus recorder (more on this piece of equipment  later). Referred to as the “push-button box” by Dr. Hogan and colleagues, the keyboard is equipped with twenty buttons, each of which represented a specific animal behaviour. The buttons are arranged in two rows of five — in an inverted “V” formation reminiscent of flocks of flying geese — that was likely designed for ergonomic ease of use by the trained observers operating them. Behaviours represented on the keyboard include preening, wing flapping, shrill calling, running, jumping, defecating, and pecking, among others. This particular keyboard was used in several experiments that monitored different collections of chick behaviour, which is perhaps evidenced by the mismatched materials that currently label its buttons.</p>

<p>The instrument consists of a sturdy steel base to minimise unwanted movement, two metal pillars, two flexible shafts, and several additional screws.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it was used, the two metal pillars would have held microneedles or micropipettes in a clamps at their upper extremities. These glass elements were typically made in the laboratory from glass tubing drawn out into a fine tip. Screws on the pillars control the horizontal and vertical movement of these glass tools by forcing apart rigid bars held together at one end by  spring plates (see Image 11.) Flexible shafts attach to the fine controls for the vertical axis, bringing the control closer to the operator and away from delicate moving parts. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operation takes place within a glass “moist-chamber” held by a mechanical stage on the microscope stage. Material to be manipulated is suspended in (a) liquid droplets(s) on the underside of a coverslip which forms the ceiling of the moist chamber. Operation on cells takes place within the moist chamber, against the bottom surface of the coverslip. Images 12 and 13  show the instrument set up with one microneedle and one micropipette.  </p>

"Microptic Theodolite","This is a theodolite contained in a green metal case (2012.ihpst.14.1), and accompanied with a tripod (2012.ihpst.14.2).

2012.ihpst.14.1: The theodolite is housed in a metal case that is painted a greyish-green with white and black speckles. The case is rectangular with a rounded top. It consists of a top half, which can be removed, and a bottom, in which the theodolite sits. It has a leather strap, attached on one side with a metal staple and on the other with a piece of plastic, with metal buckles on each end which latch the upper part of the case to the instrument base. One lowers the top of these buckles in order to open the case. The ends of the strap also have three little circles (buttons?) on them. In the bottom half of the case, in one corner, is a metal cylinder that holds a small weight with a string tied to the top of it. To the left of this, attached to the top edge of the bottom part of the case, is a metal projection that sticks straight up and has a silver knob on top of it, which is covered in small nubs. 

The theodolite itself is covered in the same tone of greyish-green enamel as the case, although without the speckles. It has a rounded base and straight sides with circles at the top It has satin-chrome finish on its knobs and other attachments, as well as a 2-inch high ring around the lens. In the middle of the instrument, the main lens folds vertically for storage but can be flipped up into a horizontal position for use. The end you look into is black, as is a secondary, skinnier lens attached to one of its sides. A metal piece with an open circle on its end sticks horizontally out of the metal that holds these two lenses together. The remainder of the description will be based on the lens being in its vertical storage position, with the actual lens part being the ""bottom."" To the left of the lens's bottom, there is a silver knob with six short, squared-off spokes. To the right of the lens's bottom, there is a round silver knob. Below and between these knobs is a hole that appears to be another lens. Below this and to the right is a silver knob that sticks out perpendicular to the hole/lens. On the side of the large central lens is a pill-shaped piece with a textured silver ring about a quarter of the way down it. Silver discs comes horizontally out of the side of the base in four places. On one short side/end, there is a thick metal knob. There is a short silver tube at the top of the instrument's side. On the other long side, there is a levelling bubble directly below the central lens. On the side of the lens is a flat silver knob. There is a small thick silver knob near the bottom of the base next to the stick-like projection that is attached to the bottom part of the case. On the other end/short side, there is another pill-shaped attachment on the top right. Directly to the left of this is a round ""door"" that can open horizontally. Directly below this is a wide silver knob, and below that is a smaller silver knob. Below the knobs is another levelling bubble. Below the bubble is a long, flat mirror that can flip out horizontally. About three inches below this another circular ""door"",  and below it another pill-shaped attachment. Near the base is another small silver knob.

A small paper manual is included inside the container. 

2012.ihpst.14.2: The tripod is composed of extendable wood and metal components. Each leg is composed of 3 wooden legs attached to adjustable tension hinges and dials at the top. At the bottom in between each set of dual wooden legs is a third extendable leg that come to a point. This third leg is released by an adjustable metal tension bracket. The entire bottom of the instrument is secured around with a leather belt strap. There are the remnants of tape with writing on it adhered to one legs.

The strap has cracking over its entire surface and has notch-like wear on its edges. The case has rust around the edges where its pieces meet. The paint is worn off near the bottom of the case all around. Underneath the strap where the top of the case meets the sides, there are large rust patches. There is a deep dent on the top of the case to the right of the ""88293"" marking. There is also a smaller, shallower dent to the left of this marking.

Tripod: One of the tripod's legs has residue on it that resembles old paper or masking tape. There are drips of both red and blue paint across the surfaces of all three legs. There is rust on the buckle on the leather strap that holds the legs together. There are nicks out of the wood of all three legs.

Theodolite: There are many but insignificant scratches all across the base. The plastic that holds the weight in its storage place is brittle and broken in places. The antenna-like piece is loose.

"Star Globe","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This instrument consists of a small globe contained in a wooden box. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The wooden box is roughly cubic, with a brass-coloured metal hand on the top and two latches on the side two hold the box closed. On the interior of the lid there are instructions for use of the globe and slid onto a metal rod, four sliding pieces with indicator arrows that can be used to indicate points on the globe. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The globe sits in the lower half of the box with a wooden surround so that only the one hemisphere of the globe is visible. It is held in place by a circular metal ring which attaches to the poles of the globe via small metal peg that is inserted into a small hole at the 'north pole' of the globe. There is a matching piece affixing the the ring to the south pole. The globe rests sideways in the box; this allows it to rotate freely around its polar axis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around the equator of the globe, affixed to the wood, there is a metal ring with a scale etched on it, in degrees of a circle. Fitted over the globe there are two half-circle rings that are fitted together at right angles at the top with a a small metal ball and attached at the base by a ring, creating a hemispherical frame; these also have scales in degrees engraved on them. This fits over the globe and can be freely lifted off and moved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The globe itself is heavy, likely made of solid wood, and the surface is cream in colour. The map is printed on varnished paper, and indicates important and prominent stars and constellations. There are two small holes with a metal lined edge in the wooden surround next to the globe. One of these contains a red marking pencil.</p>

<p>An instrument based on a known weight falling a set distance. The instruments is mounted upon a wooden base that has three adjustable legs for leveling. The instrument is secured to the base by 4 diagonal support rods and 2 central screws. The instrument is composed of two main working parts made of metal, mostly brass: a level and two pillars with adjustable components attached. The level controls the weight in the centre of the tower and rests upon a spring at one end. The pillars consist of two parallel rectangular columns. These are connected to each other by 2 horizontal adjustable bars which can be moved up and down the columns and tightened into place with screws. Between two of the adjustable components rests a weight comprised of one grey and one black metal rectangle fused together. Atop the two pillars rests a coil of copper wire attached to circuit connections. The wire is likely copper covered in a fine fabric. On the side of the base is a sticker with the old catalog tag. There is a scale on the front of the left pillar measured in centimeters.</p>

According to Titchener [1905; 1915], proper use of control apparatus depended on a good amount of precision, constant oversight, and mastery of operation. Experienced researchers tended to use complex control apparatus, while less experienced undergraduates used primitive, simpler instruments. Wundt’s famous &amp;lt;a href=""http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/utmusi/display.php?instrument_id=951""&amp;gt;Hammer Control Apparatus&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, for example, could only be used by a select group of people.

Operation of various Control Instruments depended much on the tacit knowledge, experience, personal choice, and idiosyncrasies of a given researcher. Experimenters became partial to using one of the three variations of the control instruments - hammer, pendulum or gravity chronometers. Each kind of control instrument had a family of variations - some complex, some simple.

"Control Hammer","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Five metal components are mounted on the wooden base. Two are mounted on the base itself and three are clamped to two vertical rods. Two of the components on the central rod are small electromagnetic coils. One component is an angled lever with a counterweight on one end and the ""hammer"" at the other. The fulcrum of the lever is fixed to one end of the wooden base. As the “hammer”, located at the end of the longer arm, is released by an electromagnet, it contacts two switches (an upper and lower contact), alternately opening and closing an electrical circuit, thus marking a set interval of time.  The control time is varied by shifting a counterweight at the opposite end of the lever. There are two terminals attached to the front side of each end of the base.</p>

Resonators established that ""musical tones are the simpler and more regular elements of the sensations of hearing, and that we have consequently first to study the laws and peculiarities of this class of sensations."" [Helmholtz 1863, p. 43.] 

Helmholtz’s theories of sound had a considerable impact on those interested in physics, psychology and music. Helmholtz viewed music as the one art form that had ""withdrawn itself from scientific treatment"" [Helmholtz, 1857.] Following the publication of his famous treatise on sound, Helmholtz inspired a number of researchers to make more serious studies of the laws underlying music. 

Rudolph Koenig, the maker of the above set of resonators, made a career out of ""building Helmholtz’s ideas into apparatus."" [Boring, 1942.] Rudolph Koenig was born and educated in Koenigsberg, East Prussia (currently Kaliningrad, Russia).  In 1851 Koenig moved to Paris to apprentice under Vuillaume, the celebrated violin maker. Inspired by the new research of Herman von Helmholtz and the growing ""science of musical sounds,"" Koenig started his own scientific instrument business in 1858. He quickly gained an international reputation for the quality, precision and beauty of his acoustical instruments. In 1862 and in 1876, Koenig won Gold Medals at the London and the Philadelphia exhibitions, respectively.

"Einthoven String Galvanometer","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>74.a - Einthoven String Galvanometer - A large heavy instrument with a thick solid black steel framework supported by 3 adjustable brass feet. Two horizontal cylindrical holders protrude from both the left and right sides of the front of the instrument. These hold thick steel rods with brass ends. The framework of the instrument has two thick solid arms extending horizontally to the back of the instrument which support either end of a large leather-covered galvanometer coil. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>74.b - String Carrier Attachment - This part of the instrument fits vertically at the front of the Einthoven String Galvanometer with the ""Sensitivity Wheels"" at the top. A wooden box with 2 clasps on the front, the inside has been constructed with felt-covered wooden supports made specially to house a metal instrument. The instrument consists of a black metal bar with a brass bar mounted parallel underneath it. At one end of the instrument, there are vertical dials which turn parallel to the central bars, one black and one brass, approximately 4 cm in diameter. These lie on either side of the central brass bar and are used to adjust screws that can touch the bar. Both dials read ""to increase sensitivity"" with an arrow pointing clockwise. There are 2 terminals, one black and one brass, on top of the instrument at this end. At the other end of the instrument are 2 terminals on top of the black metal bar, one brass, one black metal. There is also a smaller brass knob.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sextant is faded brass with wooden handle, angled with graduated arc below and mirror, ring mount for telescope attachments, and filters above. The ring mount has an adjusting brass knob and grooves for telescope attachments. The mirror is adjacent to the ring mount, faces away from ring mount (if the sextant is held in the right hand), and slightly cracked. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adjacent to the mirror are 4 coloured glass filters for reflected light from the mirror. Mounted adjacent to the filters is an oval glass piece, split in two. One half of this is a mirror angled to reflect light from the primary mirror to the ring mount. The other half is clear to allow direct observation through a telescope attachment on the ring mount. Adjacent to the split oval lens are three more coloured glass filters for direct light from a distant observation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The graduated arc covers roughly 60 degrees and is marked 0 to 140 on one side and 0 to 5 on the other. Finely inscribed increments between these numbers may be read using a magnifying glass attached to the measuring arm of the sextant. Measuring arm can move along the graduated arc and has a movable viewing space marked from 0 to 10. One telescope attachment is short (12.9cm) and the other long (17.9cm); each telescope is 2cm in diameter.</p>

Experimental psychologists adopted the kymograph as an instrument for recording various time-related events: response times, stimulus presentations, muscle exertion and tuning fork vibrations. The preparation of smoked paper, an art in itself, consisted of placing a blank sheet of paper over a stand and exposing it to petroleum lantern fumes.The experimenter then wrapped the smoked paper around the drum. The signal maker would contact the drum as it rotated, leaving a line record. Following the recording, the experimenter varnished the paper for permanent keeping (Titchener, 1918).

Chromograms,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A rectangular card box covered in dark blue paper that holds long slides. On the front of the box there is a label ""4 Chromogrammes variés"". Inside the box there are 12 slides set in cardboard surrounds consisting of two identical shots sitting side by side on separate glass pieces. The whole slide and surround are approximately 13.5cm in length and 6cm in width. Some of the slides are attached by two short lengths of ribbon to either another slide depicting the same images, or a piece of cardboard that is slightly smaller than the one holding the glass images. It appears that the sets of slides depicting identical were originally meant to be conjoined into a single length of ribbon.<br /><br />Each plain piece of cardboard is labelled with the image on some of the slides.

Inside, the immediate interior is painted black, further in left the natural colour of the wood. Four round holes are cut in the black section, arranged in square shape on the top of the box. On the exterior of the box, where these holes are, there is a glass plate which appears to be blackened. In each open hole section there is a clear slit in the black plate.<br /><br />Looking into the open end, a large circular lens is visible set about half way along the box, with a mirror directly behind the lens. There is a rectangular mirror attached to the lid itself. At about this point along the box, the box is open on one of its sides with a rectangular slit.

<p>This object consists of a wooden base on top of which there is a lightbulb in a ceramic socket, a second ceramic with a two pronged plug in it, and a resistor-type object in one corner. A long electrical cable with a two-pronged plug at the end is attached.<br /><br />The resistor consists of a doughnut shaped coil? mounted perpendicularly with an arm at the rear which contacts the exterior of the coil. This is rotated by means of a dial affixed to a plate on the other side of the coil. Written on this plate is: ""OHMS 100 MAX. AMPS 1.22"". This transformer is connected via wires to the ceramic socket which supports a lightbulb upright. The lightbulb is quite large, and frosted.<br /><br />Next to this, and also connected to other components via wires, there is a second ceramic lightbulb holder, which holds a two pronged plug that has been screwed into the place where the lighbulb would go. Two electrical terminals are located nearby.<br /><br />An electrical cable with yellow, red and green textile insulation emerges from behind the resistor and is wound around the instrument. At the end there is a plastic two pronged plug.</p>

""The Kromskop is an optical instrument which accomplishes for light and color what the Phonograph accomplishes for sound and the Kinetoscope for motion … The Kromskop photograph is … although not a color photograph, a color record, just as the cylinder of the phonograph, although not a cylinder of sound, contains a record of sounds, and the kinetoscope ribbon, although not an animated photograph, contains a record of motion. The phonograph cylinder must be placed in the phonograph before it can be made to reproduce the sounds recorded; the kinetoscope ribbon must pass through the kinetoscope in order to visually reproduce the moving scene; and the Kromogram must be placed in the Kromskop in order to visually reproduce the object photographed."" - Frederic Ives, Kromskop Color Photography (1898)

<p>The first component is a silver metal colour, with two front facing base legs with an upright section rounded at the top and containing the cylindrical pH measurement device. A rod for the stand is on right side. The measurement device consists of a probe to be inserted into the solution. The device contains a metallic end culminating in a wire surrounded by a clear solution, inside a glass cover. On the left end of the stand is a metal disc encased in glass, surrounded by plastic. This is possibly a light. The back is open and power cords and electrical components are exposed. Three plugs are attached, all of which fit into three sockets in the control interface.</p>

<p>The control interface consists of a metal box with two dials and a knob: one large dial in the centre to adjust volts (pH), one small dial on bottom-left, and one knob on bottom-right. There are slots on both sides of the interface that act as handles. On the back there are three sockets with different pins, each of which correspond to the plugs from the Titrimiter unit. There is a single red knob on the back between the plugs. The interface itself contains a power cord.</p>

"Photoelectric Colorimeter","<p>This is a large wooden box with an attached smaller wooden box at the rear of the object with six small slots to store small components. There is a hinged wooden flap on side of large box and on bottom there is a hinged door which opens the one side of the large box and allows access to the interior. Once opened, this door reveals a laminated operating manual affixed to its backside. The space inside the box includes a metal box with wires attached, and a number of loose components, including three individual small glass lightbulbs connected to short lengths of red wire (stored upright), metallic and glass pieces.</p>
<p>The large box has a metal plated top which holds metal switches, two plastic dials, one round slot and one rectangular slot. In the round slot there is found a long cylindrical glass vial. This metal plate is held on by a number of screws. The rectangular slot fits slides with coloured glass inset in plastic frames. These glass slide cartridges are stored in the small attached box.</p>
<p>Emerging from the large box are four different wires coated in black plastic insulation. One ends in a female socket, one is a male prong, the other two are metal electrical contact components.</p>

"Thatcher's Calculating Instrument","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Thacher's Calculating Instrument is a cylindrical slide rule which was patented by Edwin Thacher, C.E. on the first of November, 1881. The given instrument consists of a mahogany base with two metal posts at its ends, used to mount the cylindrical scale and the metal rings which provide framework for the axial segments. The slide (A scale) consists of two folded and graduated logarithmic scales; each scale from 100 to 1000 is divided into forty parts of equal length. Thus, the number of exposed sides of the bars equals the number of parts of the logarithmic scale on the slide. The bars have upper and lower lines; the lower lines are each, one of the forty parts of the logarithmic scale and are in contact with the slide underneath. The upper lines feature an extended scale of square roots. This instrument is packaged in a fitting mahogany box with latches.</p>

<p>Hanging from the mechanism is a pendulum consisting of a rigid metal rod with two mottled glass cylindrical containers affixed on either side of the rod by a metal frame. These can be filled with liquid to increase their weight. Beneath the pendulum there is a slightly curved scale labeled from '0' in the centre to ""2"" on either side. Hanging loosely alongside the rod there is a metal cord attached to a small pulley wheel.</p>

Chronometer,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This instrument is a tall precision chronometer resembling a grandfather clock. The case is wood with a glass fronted door hinged on the right and closed by two locks, with keyholes on the left side of the case. Affixed to the rear of the case there is a metal plate. On the left side of the case there are two cylindrical electrical posts with screw tops; these pass through the case to the interior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside the case, the clock instrument consists of a large silver-coloured metal face with a single hand in the centre; this dial is labeled in minutes, with ""60"" at the top. Inside the face of the larger dial there are two smaller dials, each with a single central hand. The upper dial measure seconds (0-60) and the lower 24 hours. There is a round hole in the seconds dial, just above where the hand is fixed. Also on the face, there is also a smaller round hole with a square peg in the centre of it. The clock mechanism is located behind the face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A pendulum hangs below the face. This constists of a large vertical rod with a cylindrical weight fixed to the base. Hanging beside this, although detatched, there is a looped string with a metal pulley hanging loosely off it. Beneath the pendulum rod there is a small arced scale with 0 in the centre, and graduated in tenths on either side, labeled up to 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Loose in the base of the case there are two metal tins with blue lids and paper stickers affixed to their lids. Each of these contains a small number of weights. One is labeled ""Rm 18"" (2012.ast.21.2), the other ""Rm 77"" (2012.ast.21.3). Also in the case, there is a wooden box with a hinged lid and a key in the front. This is a weight set consisting of different weights (2012.ast.21.4).  There is also a cylindrical metal weight loose in the base of the case (2012.ast.21.5).</p>

"Anatomical Model of the Ear","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Large detailed replica of an ear made from papier-mâché. Surface detail includes blood vessels and circulation patterns. Each component of the ear is discretely labelled, often with numbers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This object consists of five components, tagged as 2010.ph.351.a,b,c,d,e, some of which include additional divisions. Pictures of the components are shown in the order in which they are described.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Component a: This piece is the outer ear portion of the Papier-mâché model. It has no further divisions. It provides a detail of the ear lobe, including blood vessels and blood circulation areas. There are two metal pins on the relative 'back' of the piece to facilitate its attachment to component b.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Component b: This piece is the largest single component of the papier-mâché ear model, consisting of an enclosure of the inner ear. It attaches directly to component a via two pin holes located on the ""outside"" of this piece. Raised blood vessels make up the surface detail, and red paint indicates areas of blood flow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Component c: This piece is a smaller 'cap' that attaches to the largest component (b). Together they form the total enclosure of the smaller inner ear pieces of the Papier-mâché model of the ear. This piece can be secured to the larger part with two small metal pins that protrude from either end of it, as well as a pivoting latch that is near one of the pins. As per the rest of the model, surface details include raised blood vessels as well as blood circulation patterns. This piece is largely hollow on the inside, allowing the smaller parts of the ear to be nestled inside when closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Component d: This piece is an interior component of the Papier-mâché ear model. It consists of three smaller pieces that fit together to form a cohesive whole. The largest piece is a large pretzel-shaped twist. One side of the ""pretzel"" is cut away to reveal the interior. In this cavity, a removable ring fits into the loop. The ring appears brittle and in poor condition. This piece slots into another piece, that along with the third and final piece form a round shell shape. These pieces have less raised surface detail than the other parts of the model, but somewhat more vivid and preserved colours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Component e: This piece is a Papier-mâché representation of the tympanic membrane of the ear.

"D.C. Ammeter","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Direct Current Ammeter is mounted on a wooden base with a vertical wooden backboard that supports the instrument upright. At the top of the face is an arc-shaped linear scale calibrated in amperes, graduated in tenths between units and labelled in units of 0.1 from 0-1.0. The scale is covered with glass cover, and has a translucent white back. There is a needle on the scale. On the scale, beneath the arc, there is the words ""USE WITH EXTERNAL SHUNT"".<br /><br />There is raised lettering on the face of the instrument below the scale, this includes maker information and the serial number. <br /><br />On the rear of the instrument, directly behind the scale is a light bulb socket, minus the bulb, apparently meant to illuminate the scale from behind. To either side of the socket are two electrical terminals, labeled ""Positive"" and ""Negative"", with green plastic label-maker labels. These terminals are connected via yellow insulated electrical wires to the rear of the instrument.<br /><br />Mounted on the vertical board at the rear of the instrument, there are also four sets of terminals. These are arranged in sets of two, each set affixed to a vertically oriented plastic piece, with one terminal above another. Each set is labelled with a different amperage with labels set on the top edge of the board: ""1 AMP., 5 AMP., 10 AMP., and 20 AMP.. Each terminal (except for the 20 AMP. terminal) has an additional metal plaque on the plastic piece between the terminals, indicating amperage and what model it is to be used with.<br /><br />Two small electrical terminals sit on the upper edge of the vertical board, in between the amperage labels.  </p>

These are labelled ""Std. Cell"", ""A"", ""B"", ""C"" ""BATT."" and ""GALV."" In the middle of the Bakelite surface there are three large ridged Bakelite knobs arranged in a row. From left to right, these are labelled ""CIRCUIT SWITCH"", ""VOLTS"" and ""RHEOSTAT"". The latter two have connected arrows which act as pointers on a circular arrangement of markings on the surface. Turning these two knobs turns apparatus inside the instrument among the circles of coils. <br /><br />Next to these there is a flexible strip of metal above a metal peg; this can be depressed to touch the peg. This is labelled, ""Std.

This motor is attached by an insulated yellow wire to a rheostat consisting of a cylindrical coil with a sliding section that rides along a metal bar along its length. This is next to two white round objects sitting low on the base. A second yellow wire passes through a hole in the wooden base.<br /><br />At the other end of the base to the motor is a pump apparatus consisting of a belt driven wheel with a handle attached and other pieces, and a short, disc-shaped cylindrical glass chamber set in a metal surround that sits on a metal support structure with various adjustments via knobs and screws. These pieces are on their own metal base and all are painted green. This metal base is bolted to the larger wooden base.<br /><br />A second switch made of copper with a black handle set on a wooden base is affixed to the wood next to the chamber and pump assembly.</p>
