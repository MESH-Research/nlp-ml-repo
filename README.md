# nlp-ml-repo
## Introduction
This repository contains tutorials, materials for testing purposes, and other documents relating to natural language processing and machine learning. It's first created by Titi KH while primarily working with Ian Scott (with a lot of support from Mike Thicke! And of course other super duper cool co-workers, Cassie, Dimitrios, Brian, and Bonnie).

## Phrase 1: 2023 Fall/Winter 
After gaining basic understanding of KC and other knowledge (e.g. docker environments, how to use API to access some stats,etc.), I became more clear of my short-term and long-term goals:
- testing .py libraries for extracting text from different typoes of deposited files
- clean them and build (a) structured dataframe(s)
- perform topic modeling or other analysis on the data at hand.

All related materials can be found in the subfolder "text-extraction".

  ### Resources I still need to check out
  - Machine Learning in Python (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), potetntially talk to Stephaine Vasko.
